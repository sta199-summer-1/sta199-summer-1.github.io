## Peer Review 

![](images/teammates.png)

-- Each of you should have received an invite email (reach out to me if you did not)

-- Due March 29th at 11:59 

-- Answers will be private 

-- Encouraged to have conversations with groupmates if things are not going well

## Peer Review Purpose

-- Accountability 

-- Part of your grade

# Project

## Feedback 

-- Feedback can be seen in **Issues* tab 

-- Expectation is to respond to feedback on data set you choose for your project

## Issues

![](images/issues.png)

-- See lab 7 on how to respond + close issues created by myself and lab leaders

-- Project Draft Report is Due April 7th 

## Project Tips{.smaller} 

-- Own your work vs "that part wasn't mine"

-- Research Question 

--- Can you answer it? 

-- Introduction 

--- Do not copy + paste the description given on the website 

--- Do some digging

--- Write a brief description of the observations.

--- Address ethical concerns about the data, if any.

## Project Highs

-- Really impressed with mini literature review 

-- Creative + interesting research questions 

-- I look forward to what you do next!


## Project Draft Report 

-- Introduction and data

-- Methodology

-- Results

-- W+F 

--- update about section 

--- Respond to all *issues* from chosen data set 

--- Everyone is your group must have at least 3 commits 

## Where we are going

$\checkmark$ Data Viz

$\checkmark$ Probability

$\checkmark$ Modeling Data

-- Estimating population parameters (confidence intervals)

-- Testing population parameters (hypothesis testing)

## Goals

-- Quick re-run through of ROC curves

-- What is bootstrapping?

-- What is a confidence interval?

## ROC Curves 

Plot of a model's true positive and false positive rates based on a testing data set 

-- Used for model evaluation (AUC)

-- Can be used to help pick a threshold to make decisions 


## ROC Curve

## ROC creation

## AE-16

Predict spam based on number of exclamation points + winner

![](images/ae-16.png)

AUC ~ 0.650

## Picking a threshold

```
email_pred |>
  roc_curve(
    truth = spam, 
    .pred_1, 
    event_level = "second" #a success
  ) 
```

## Confidence Intervals

-- are a range of plausible values that our population parameter could be 

--- and we almost always don't actually know what this value is .... but we want to!

## Confidence Intervals

By the end of class, we will 

-- know how to calculate confidence intervals using bootstrap methods 

-- understand what bootstrap methods are 

-- understand how the level of confidence influences our confidence interval 

-- understand how to interpret a confidence interval in the context of the problem


# ae-17

## In Summary

-   Bootstrap methods are simulation methods

-   Variability - *Uncertainty*: How spread out your data are

-   We can use this to guess plausible values around our parameter of interest

-   This is called a confidence interval, and it's different than probability
