## Checklist

-- Clone ae-10

-- HW-2 coming shortly after class (due 1-week)

-- Groups public soon after class

-- team repos for lab

## Announcements 

-- Do not start lab-4 early 

-- Gradescope vs Gradebook 

## Goals 

Exploring Relationships of data 

- be able to define and compute **marginal**, **joint** and **conditional** probabilities

- Fill in contingency tables 

- identify when events are independent

- Have an understanding of Bayes' theorem

- Simpson's Paradox

## Last Time

-- Terms

-   Event

-   Sample Space

## Last Time: Types of probabilities

-- Single Event

-- "And"

-- "Or"

## Same Concept - Different Names

-- Single Event : Marginal Probability

-- "And" : Joint Probability

-- "Or" : Joint Probability

## Same Concept - Different Terms

-- P(A and B) = P(A $\cap$ B)

-- P(A or B) = P(A $\cup$ B)

## Quick Example {.smaller}

![](images/warmup.prob.png){width="600" height="300" fig-align="center"}

Let A represent being cured from the disease

Let B represent taking the drug

-   What's the sample space for A?

-   P(A) =

-   P(A and B) =

-   P(A or B) =

## Conditional Probability

-- formally, we define conditional probability as P(A\|B)

-- "\|" represents "given"

## Example

Let A represent being cured from the disease

Let B represent taking the drug

![](images/warmup.prob.png){width="600" height="300" fig-align="center"}

--   P(B\|A) =

## Helpful rules: Bayes Theorem

-- is a mathematical formula used to determine the conditional probability of events.

-- describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of the conditions that might be relevant to the event

-- P(A\|B) = $\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}$

## In action

Let A represent being cured from the disease

Let B represent taking the drug

![](images/warmup.prob.png){width="600" height="300" fig-align="center"}

P(A\|B) = $\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}$

## Helpful rules: Law of total probability

-- the probability that A occurs is equal to the sum of the probabilities that A occurs with B and that A occurs without B

-- P(A) = P(A and B) + P(A and $B^c$)


## Helpful rules: Independence

-- P(A\|B) = P(A)

## Independence

Let A represent being cured from the disease

Let B represent taking the drug

-- Are A and B independent?

## Simpson's Paradox

-- is a statistical phenomenon where an association between two variables in a population emerges, disappears or reverses when the population is divided into subpopulations
