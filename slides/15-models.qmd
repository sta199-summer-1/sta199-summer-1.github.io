-- What is the relationship?

-- What is your best guess for a car's MPG that weighs 5000 pounds?

## What is a statistical model?

-- Statistical modeling is the process of applying statistical analysis to a data set.

-- A statistical model is a mathematical representation of observed data.

# Probability

## Probability

-   A random process is one in which the outcome is unpredictable. We encounter random processes every day: will it rain today? how many minutes will pass until receiving your next text message? will the Packers win the Super Bowl?

-   The probability of an event is the long-run proportion of times the event would occur if the random process were repeated indefinitely (under identical conditions).

## Types of Probabilities

-- Single Event

-- Conditional

-- And

## Notation

We will denote "events" by upper case letters near the beginning of the alphabet

-- P(A)

-- P(A\|B)

-- P(A U B)

## Examples {.smaller}

We often calculate probabilities using a table. Consider the following example:

|               |       |           |        |
|---------------|-------|-----------|--------|
|               | Cured | Not-Cured | Totals |
| New Drug      | 145   | 250       | 395    |
| Standard Drug | 300   | 305       | 605    |
|               | 445   | 555       | 1,000  |

-   What is the probability of $A$?

-   What is the probability of $B^c$

-   What is the probability of $B$ and $A$?

-   What is the probability of $B$ given $A$?

## Example

As a student at Duke University, suppose your first class on Mondays is in Old Chemistry at 8:00am and you commute to school. From past experience, you know that there is a 20% chance of finding an open parking spot in Lot 6. Otherwise, you have to park in Lot 18. If you find a spot in Lot 6, you only have a 5% chance of being late to class. However, if you have to park in Lot 18, you have a 15% chance of being late to class.

## Step 1

"you know that there is a 20% chance of finding an open parking spot in Lot 6."

## Step 2

"if you park in Lot 6, the probability of being late to class is 5%; if you park in Log 18, the probability of being late to class is 15%.

## Step 3

|        | Late to class | Not late to class | Totals |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Lot 6  | 10            | 190               | 200    |
| Lot 18 | 120           | 680               | 800    |
|        | 130           | 870               | 1,000  |
