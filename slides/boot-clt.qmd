## Warm Up

## Warm Up 

Our goal is to create a 95% confidence interval to estimate the true mean fipper length of penguins.

-- What are the simulation methods called to create a confidence interval?

-- How is one observation ("dot") created when using such simulation methods? 

Note: There are 344 penguins in the data set. 

## Warm Up 

-- What are the simulation methods called to create a confidence interval?

- Bootstrap methods 


## Warm Up 

-- How is one observation ("dot") created when using such simulation methods? 

- Sample WITH REPLACEMENT 344 (n) times 

- Calculate the new sample mean

## Last Time 

-- Calculated bootstrap confidence intervals 

-- Interpreted confidence intervals

## Last Time

-- What is the difference between confidence and probability? 

-- Why is using the term probability incorrect when interpreting a confidence interval? 

## Confidence vs Probability 

-- Probability is simply how likely something is to happen

--- This implies that the event has not happened yet! 

--- This implies that there is a random outcome associated with this event.

## Probability coin example 

What is the probability that this coin will land on heads?

- Before the flip, what's the probability that this coin lands on heads 

- What about when it lands? 

- What about if I cover it with my hand so you can't see it? 

- What about if I flip it and cover it with my hand so you can't see it? 

- *Takeaway*: Being unknown is not the same as being random 

## Confidence

Confidence - the percentage of all possible confidence intervals, created under the same conditions, expected to include the true population parameter

-- For your confidence interval, the parameter is not random

- *Takeaway*: Being unknown is not the same as being random 


## What you need to know 

-- Correct: We are 95% confident the true mean price per night for Airbnbs in Asheville is between 63.3 and 91.0 dollars.

-- Incorrect: There is a 95% probability the true mean price per night for an Airbnb in Asheville is between 63.3 and 91.0.

## For Today 

-- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

-- What impacts confidence intervals

-- How to use CLT in practice

## Goal of Statistical Inference 

-- Before we define CLT, let's remind ourselves of our goal... 

**We are interested in population parameters, which we do not observe. So we calculate statistics from our sample to learn about them**

**As part of this process, we must quantify the degree of uncertainty in our sample statistic** - which is why we make distributions!

## Central Limit Theorem 

-- For a large enough n, the shape of the sampling distribution of the means is ~ normally distributed 

-- As n -> $\infty$, the mean of the sample distribution is identical to the population mean $\mu$ (so for a large n, our best guess of $\mu$ is the mean of the sampling distribution)

-- The standard deviation of the distribution of the sample means is $\frac{s}{\sqrt(n)}$ (so for a large n, our best guess of $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution)

We will use the above guesses when we use a normal distribution to calculate a confidence interval

## Assumptions 

-- Independence 

-- Sample Size 

## Independence 

-- Independent observations 

-- "Does one observation influence the other?"

## Sample Size 

-- n > 30 (for quantitative variables)

-- 10 successes + 10 failures (for categorical variables)

## ae-18 

We will walk through the CLT in action 

Practice creating confidence intervals using the CLT and Bootstrap methods 

## Discussion 

-- Bootstrapping is less restrictive when it comes to sample size ( ~ n > 10)

-- CLT does not work for other statistics besides the mean

-- Both require the independence assumption
