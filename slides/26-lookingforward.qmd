## Checklist 

-- Clone `LookingForward1`

-- If a tab comes up to install packages, do so. 

-- Click `install` in the tab or use install.packages("package.name")

## Announcements 

-- Project presentations due Thursday 

-- One more peer review 

-- Fill out presentation info (link on Sakai)

-- ^ This is also where you will find the link to review presentations

-- Please include team(#) information on title slide

## Announcements 

-- Exam 2 grades are published 

-- If you missed points for only stating hypotheses in Q4 or Q5, submit a regrade request

-- Exam retake repos are published 

## Goals 

-- What does statistics / data science look like outside of university?

-- Overview of Spatial Statistics

# The best thing about being a statistician is that you get to play in everyone's backyard

## Atrium {.smaller}

-- Perform EDA and data analysis using Python and R (in a reproducible format)

-- Build and productionize models

-- Manage cross functional teams with business SMEs that validate model insights, data experts who assist in managing/integrating data, and communicate progress/insights to executive stakeholders

-- Communicate results to a broad set of non-technical people (typically in tools like Powerpoint/Slides as well as in reproducible docs like RMarkdown/Jupyter Notebooks)

-- Build analytics dashboards in tools like Tableau or PowerBI to display data


--- https://atrium.ai/about/

## USGS {.smaller}

-- development of new statistical techniques to analyze various data types

-- development of products to communicate those techniques to wildlife managers and facilitate their implementation (this is a pretty big one that occupies a lot of my time

-- development of software for analysis and data visualization

-- use of version control software

-- use of probabilistic programming languages like stan, nimble, and jags

-- writing up samplers in C++ and Julia (data science kids might get a kick out of this, happy to share some julia code if that is the case)

-- a big part of the job is also communicating results to government folks that don't know anything about statistics

## Closing Thoughts 

-- We live in a world of big data 

-- These are necessary skills that will follow you into your career, even if you are not specifically a data scientist or statistician 


# Looking Forward Topic 1: Spatial Statistics


## Spatial Modeling Overview

Researchers in many fields are faced with analyzing data with a spatial component. These analyses typically include:

  - modeling trends and correlation structures
  - estimation of underlying model parameters
  - hypothesis testing or model comparision
  - prediction of observations at unobserved times or locations
  
## Spatial Data Viz Tools

There are many tools for creating spatial figures (GIS software, Tableau, etc...), but we will exclusively use R and the wide range of packages within it.

In particular, we will use:

- `ggplot2`

- `leaflet`

- and more...
