## Goals for today

Basics we will use throughout the semester

-   R and RStudio
-   Quarto Documents
-   More Practice

## What is R and RStudio?

-- R is a statistical programming language

-- RStudio is a convenient interface for R

## Warm Up Question {.smaller}

Please think through / write down what each line of code would produce.

Tip (and good practice): *if you have questions about a function, use ?function.name to pull up the help page!* If the help page is not helpful, look at their examples section and click *Run Examples*.

## Some R essentials

-- **Functions** are (normally) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

## R essentials

-- **Packages** are installed with the install.packages function and loaded with the **library** function, once per session:

## GitHub: Version control

# Demo: Try it!

## Quarto

-- an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

-- publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more

-- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## How will we use Quarto?

-- Every assignment / lab / project will be given to you as a Quarto document

-- You will always have a Quarto template document to start with

-- As we get more familiar with R, the more code you will construct on your own

## Wrap up

-- What is version control? Why is it important?

-- What is R vs RStudio?

-- What is Quarto?
