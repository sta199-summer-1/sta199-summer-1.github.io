## Checklist

-   Clone your `merge-demo-summer` project in RStudio. Do not make any changes to it after you clone.

-   HW-2 is out. **Due Thursday by 5:00**

-   Are you keeping up with prepare material?

## Announcements

-- Exam 1 - June 1st

-- Project is starting up!

## Exam{.smaller} 

-- Will be released today between 5-6 

-- Individual assignment only

-- RENDER AND PUSH AFTER EVERY QUESTION 

-- Due Monday at **Noon** 

-- Slack for clarification questions 

-- All questions will be in the README of the exam-summer repo 

-- All questions will be answered in the exam.qmd

-- Start early. It make take you 5 hours.... or 15.... and that's fine!


## Project

You now have your project repos! 

Let's take a tour...

## Lab Expectations 

-- During lab, you will work on your project with your group 

-- After lab, you are to "table" the project until after the exam

-- Project proposal due **June 12th**


## Warm Up 1 

-- When you see an `NA` in a data set, what are some possibilities it could represent?

-- Are we justified to always change `NAs` to 0? 

## Warm Up 2

## Warm Up 3 

-- Why do we use GitHub? 


## GitHub 

At its core, Git keeps track of changes to files and allows multiple users to coordinate updates to those files.

## GitHub 

But.... not on the same lines of code at the same time..... 

## GitHub

## GitHub 

Not all merge conflicts are bad! 


## GitHub Rules for Collaboration 

-- ALWAYS PULL before starting your work 

-- Commit and push every and all documents. Merge conflicts occur when someone saves changes, but doesn't push them to GitHub. 

-- If merge conflicts happen, we can fix (most) of them! We will talk about this during our first activity today. 

## merge conflict 

-- The first activity we will do is the merge-demo-summer activity. 

-- Clone this and assign a Role number 1 through 4. If you have more than 4 members, alternate. 

-- Do not change this document until the activity begins. 

-- Click on the icon under the `ae_sa` column on the website for today to find activity instructions. 

# Part 2: Statistical Inference 

## What is it? 

-- The claims that we can make from research around population parameters 

- So what are population parameters? 

## Populatin Parameters 

-- Population parameters represent the *truth* or *true summary statistics* of an entire population. 

- We are almost always interested in these as the researcher 

- And we can almost never know exactly what these are.... 

## Example 

Duke Students' Height 


## Statistical Inference 

-- Test to see if parameters are different from a value, or from each other 

-- Estimate population parameters 

## Quantifying variability 

-- Variability is understood as the lack of consistency. As we take samples from a population, will we always get the same value back? 

## Distribution 

But some values are more common and some are uncommon

We use distributions to understand that. This allows us to conduct hypothesis tests and make confidence intervals.
