## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-11`

## Announcements

-- HW-2 Due **Friday** at 11:59

-- Lab 4 Due **Tuesday** at 11:59

## Data Fest 2023 at Duke {.smaller}

-- data analysis competition where teams of up to five students attack a large, complex, and surprise dataset over a weekend

-- DataFest is a great opportunity to gain experience that employers are looking for

-- Each team will give a brief presentation of their findings that will be judged by a panel of judges comprised of faculty and professionals from a variety of fields.

## Lab 4

-- Team Submission

-- Attach ALL team members to submission on Gradescope

-- Communicate!

-- "It was my responsibility to turn the lab in and I forgot...."

## Warm up: Simpson's Paradox

What is it?

Why is it important?

## Where we are going

$\checkmark$ Data Viz

$\checkmark$ Probability

-- Modeling Data

## Goals

-- Introduce the idea of modeling

-- Why we model data?

--- Modeling with single predictors

--- How to write equations

--- Interpret Slopes

--- Interpret Intercepts

## Warm up 2

![](images/scattercar.png){fig-align="center" width="700"}

-- What is the relationship?

-- What is your best guess for a car's MPG that weighs 5000 pounds? 3000 pounds?

## What is a statistical model?

-- Statistical modeling is the process of applying statistical analysis to a data set.

-- A statistical model is a mathematical representation of observed data.

## Why

-- Interpretation

-- Prediction

## What is linear regression?

-- Model data using **a straight line**

-- Quantitative response

-- Quantitative or categorical explanatory

## Model Notation - Population

$$ Y_i = \beta\_o + \beta\_1x_i +\epsilon\_i$$

$$ Y\; - True\; mean\;response $$

$$\beta\_o\; -True\; intercept$$

$$\beta\_1\; - True\; slope\; coefficient$$

$$\epsilon\_i\; -  Error\; term\; for\; each\; observation\; i$$

## Model Notation - Estimated

$$\hat{Y} = b + b_1x$$

$$\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta_o} + \hat{\beta_1}x$$

$$\hat{Y} - estimated\; (predicted)\; mean \;response$$

$$\hat{\beta_o} - estimated\; intercept$$

$$\hat{\beta_1} - estimated\; slope$$ We assume that our error term is normally distributed and has a mean of 0. Thus, it does not show up in our model.

## Model Notes {.smaller}

Things to note:

X is our explanatory variable and is not random. We know the value of X.

Y is our response variable. For a fixed X, Y will be a random variable (have a random outcome).

This random outcome is observed based on a random draw from a distribution we assume.

When using this model for prediction, we expect Y to take on the most likely value for a given X... which is the center of the distribution.

Let's draw it out...

## Takeaway

So, for an observed X..... we are modeling the mean of the distribution of Y

Or, Y is a mean response

**"we estimate a mean change in Y"**

**"we estimate, on average....."**

**This is extremely important when we think about interpretation**

## Summary

-- Y is a random variable.

-- We assume that observations from this random variable are normally distributed.

-- Because of this distributional assumption, we are modeling the **mean** of Y and not just Y.

## Wrap up: Check yourself

-- What is a model?

-- What are the 2 main reasons we fit models?

-- Slope coefficients? Intercepts?

-- How does linear regression change when x is quantitative vs categorical?
