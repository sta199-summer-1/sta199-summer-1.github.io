## Announcements

-- Lab Feedback (Check it regardless of your grade)

-- HW4 Question 2

## Goals

-- Overfitting

-- "New" function in R

Summary on Regression

-- Why we model data?

-- Can I write out models?

-- Can I interpret model output?

-- Do I understand the difference between models?

## Warm Up

Discuss the difference between the two models below. Which model would you prefer to fit to model these data? Why?

## Overfitting

-- Overfitting is a concept in data science, which occurs when a statistical model fits exactly against its data.

-- This doesn't make sense if are goal is to predict!

## Why we use regression

-   Predict the value of our response

-   Estimate the effect of some explanatory variable on the response (examine the relationship)

-   Make inference about some larger population (coming later)

## When and why we use regression

-   Quantitative Response

-   Does it make sense

## Extension (Coming Later)

To test hypotheses and make conclusions, certain assumptions need to be met....

-- Normality of Residuals

-- Linearity

-- Independence

-- Constant Variance

## Adjusted R-squared

## Modeling More Than One Variable

-- **Multiple linear regression** is used to estimate the relationship between **two or more** explanatory variables and one response variable.

-- we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables

-- "account for X1 and assess the relationship between X2 and Y" - main effects

-- "does X1's relationship with Y change based on X2"

## Logistic Regression

-- What if the response variable is categorical?
