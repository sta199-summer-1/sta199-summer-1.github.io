## Outline 

-- What 

-- Why 

-- How

-- Benefits 

... of Quarto in Introductory Data Science

## What Is Data Science

- Answers will vary 

- science of planning for, acquisition, management, analysis of, and inference from data‚Äù (NSF2014)

## What Is Data Science

- Data scientists are involved from the beginning to end stages of the research process 

- The research process is much more than learning how to model data 

## What is Quarto 

-- Reproducibility tool 

-- New generation R-markdown 

-- results from your data analysis and written commentary into a reproducible document 

(Create figure instead of bullet points here)

## The Connection 

Reproducibility tool <==> Research Process 

Quarto <==> Data Science 

Thus, Quarto isn't something "extra" in a data science course.... it's the foundation FOR it!

## Argument for Quarto

Teaching reproducibility tools (such as Quarto) should not be viewed as an additional topic, but instead should be the foundation behind any introductory course to instill good habits for future researchers 

Make reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception


## Reproducibility: Why This Matter 

Crisis: Lack of Trust in Science

# How 

## Quarto in Introductory Data Science 

From the perspective of ...

-- 150 students with little to no statistics / data science / coding experience 

-- Teaching using the `dsbox` curricula (cite) 

-- Students are expected to use R 

-- Topics include data visualization; data cleaning; data modeling 

## How 

Common Themes in the following demonstrations...

-- Teach quarto code side-by-side with the other coding languages

-- Make reproducibility an expectation

-- Lean into what Quarto has to offer 

- Informative Syntax Completion 

- Visual and Source Mode 

- Informative Error Messages 

- More...

## Quarto Tour 

First things we teach...

(Picture of qmd)

Highlight YAML; Highlight Render; Where to put code; Where to put text 

## Informative Syntax and Completion

Informative syntax aligns with what you want to accomplish "how do I turn these messages off?"

## Informative Syntax and Completion 

Fig-height and width is as important as making the figure itself. It's all learned together. "How do I adjust my figure width and figure height?"

## Visual Tab 

::: {#fig-R layout-ncol="2"}

:::

Highlight how coding can be more approachable in the visual tab 

Gets students trained to think about and visualize professional documents throughout the process. Making this the expectation, and again not something additional 

## Errors 

Highlight the approachability of Quarto error messages and how this can help alleviate some tension in an intro class

Examples of common errors and the error messages (Ask Mine)

## Example AE 

Link to AE that shows off what is highlighted above

Highlight the following: 

Minimal YAML
Minimal chunk options
Use well scaffolded Quarto documents
Render early and often!

# Benefits 

## From the student's perspective 

-- Useful tool: Good habit to build for future coursework / career

-- Work they can be proud of 

-- [Example](Lisa Work)


## From the instructor's perspective 

Efficiency: Consistent formatting -> easier grading

Invest time into lessons / activities now -> adapt later 

## If you don't use R 

Extendability: Use with Python, and Julia, and Observable, and more

## In Summary 

-- Reproducibility is not optional

-- And has a place in any introductory class with coding

-- Set the expectation 

-- Start **Minimal** and build up!

# Questions 













## What topics are covered 

-- Topic 1 

-- Topic 2 

-- Topic 3 

## Example Application Exericse 

-- Emphasis on reproducibility and taking time to show that during activities 


## Topics specific in Quarto 

-- How to create professional documents...

--- YAML customization

--- Integrate R-code (control with code chunk arguments)

--- customize figures 

--- website generation (show off student work at the end of presentation)
