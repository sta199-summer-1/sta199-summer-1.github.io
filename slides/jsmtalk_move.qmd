Should the title be "Teaching WITH Quarto in Intro to Data Science? This would make it a lot more broad and easier to discuss vs just focusing in on the the quarto logistics we teach 

## Outline for Talk 

-- Opening: Lack of trust in science 

One way we can combat this is transparency and reproducibility 


## Reproducibility  Crisis: Lack of Trust in Science 

![](images/01-welcome-199/pnas.png){fig-align="center"}

## Quarto 

Make reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception

Bringing this into an intro course helps have conversations about the importance of reproducibility and instills a foundation of good habits early and often 

## Background: STA199 

-- What it is 

-- Who the students are 

-- Topics involved 

This is all done through Quarto 



## How 

Seamlessly integrates into more modernized teaching 

**Do we talk about GitHub's role in helping students with Quarto? ex. Repo generation with quarto documents inside** <- I think if the title is changed, then this makes sense. This falls under the category of an extension to "teaching WITH quarto"

## What topics are covered 

-- Topic 1 

-- Topic 2 

-- Topic 3 

## Example Application Exericse 

-- Emphasis on reproducibility and taking time to show that during activities 


## Topics specific in Quarto 

-- How to create professional documents...

--- YAML customization

--- Integrate R-code (control with code chunk arguments)

--- customize figures 

--- website generation (show off student work at the end of presentation)
