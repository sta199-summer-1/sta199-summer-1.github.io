## Checklist

-- Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-s23-2) and find your `lab-02` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name).

-- Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo

## Announcements

-- HW-1 due tonight (11:59) - Gradescope

-- Labs due Fri (11:59) - Gradescope

-- Do not forget to select pages!!

## Inline text Demo

-- How to seamlessly add code output to bodies of text

## Example

-- Inline R code is embedded in the narratives of the document (outside the code chunk) using the syntax:

![](images/r.png){width="80" height="50"}

-- In the rendered document, code in the syntax will display the output.

## Why this matters

-- Efficiency

-- Reproducibility

## Common Mistakes

-- Forgetting the tick marks

-- Forgetting the r

# Check your document to make sure the code produces what you think

# group_by

## group_by

-- group_by() takes an existing tbl and converts it into a grouped tbl where operations are performed "by group"

-- often used with `summarize()`

## group_by

![](images/group_by.png){fig-align="\"center"}
