## Warm Up 

Glimpse `mtcars` if you need to refamilarize yourself with these data


```
mtcars |>
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
  
---------------------------------
mtcars |>
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl)) |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
```

## Warm Up{.smaller} 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars |>
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))

mtcars |>
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl)) |>
  group_by(cyl) |>
  summarize(mean_mpg = mean(mpg))
```


## Goals

-- Understand join functions

-- Join multiple data frames

## Motivation 

Messy data

-- The sheer volume of information is sometimes referred to as “messy” data, because it's hard to make sense of it all.

# How? 

## Joining datasets

**Data merging** is the process of combining two or more data sets into a single data set. Most often, this process is necessary when you have raw data stored in multiple files, worksheets, or data tables, that you want to analyze together.

## Joining datasets 

-- Left Join 

-- Inner Join 

-- Right Join 

-- Full Join

## Recap of AE

-- This is important! Data are messy!

-- Think carefully about the join you use
