## Announcements

-- Exam 2 on Thursday

-   Released at noon

-   No slack or TA office hours

-   Don't cheat

-   Due Monday at 2

-- All keys are posted (or will be posted before noon tomorrow)

## Grading Questions

-- EC for Exam 1 is not in

-- Lowest HW is dropped

-- Lowest Lab is dropped

## Study Tips - Variables

-- Identify variables

-   Categorical vs Quantitative

-   Explanatory vs Response

## Models by Variable Type {.smaller}

-- Simple Linear Regression: 1 Quantitative Response; 1 Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variable

-- Mulitple Linear Regression: 1 Quantitative Response; 2 or more Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variables

-- Logistic Regression: 1 Categorical Response (Binary); 1 or more Categorical or Quantitative Explanatory Variables

## Study Tips - Make your own guide

```{r}
#| eval: false

                                  #arguments: new name = calculated statistic

## Exam Format

-- Short response questions

-- Application questions

-- Extension questions

## Goals

-- Review

-   Simpson's Paradox

-   P-value interpretation

-- Compare two means, and do a bootstrap interval

-- Prediction and bootstrap interval for the slope

## Simpson's Paradox {.smaller}

Describe the relationships observed in the scatter plot. Comment on: Form; Strength; Direction.

## Simpson's Paradox - Same Data... Ungrouped {.smaller}

What about now?

![](images/simp2.png){width="350" height="400" fig-align="center"}

... a trend appears in groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined.

## p-values

-- What is it?

-- How do we interpret it?

## p-values

-- **Probability**

-- of observing **what we did** or something **more extreme**

-- given $H_O$ = T

## Example

Airbnb Example

-- Response variable: price per guest

-- Assume Ho: $\mu$ = 60

-- p-value \~ 0.14

![](images/pvalueexample.png){fig-align="center"}

## Example {.smaller}

![](images/pvalueexample.png)

The **probability** of observing a mean price per guest of **76.6 dollars**, or **something larger**, assuming that the **true mean price per guest of Ashville, NC Airbnbs in June 2020 was 60 dollars** is equal to \~ 0.14.
