## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-16`

-- Review context of `ae-15` for warm up question

## Announcements

-- Lab Feedback

-- Project Repos Coming

## Goals

-- Finish categorical single predictor

-- Model with multiple predictors

-- Adjusted R-squared

## Warm Up

Recall that we ended last class by modeling the relationship between a penguin's body mass and the insland they were recorded on. Using the following output, write the estimated model below:

## Further

-- What if we want to account for both their flipper length and island?

-- Would a different model explain more variation in the response body mass?

## Modeling More Than one Variable

-- **Multiple linear regression** is used to estimate the relationship between **two or more** explanatory variables and one response variable.

-- we want to predict the value of a variable based on the value of two or more other variables

-- "account for X1 and assess the relationship between X2 and Y" - main effects

-- "does X1's relationship with Y change based on X2"

## In Summary
