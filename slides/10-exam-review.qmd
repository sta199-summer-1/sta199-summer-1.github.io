## Checklist

-- Clone exam review repo

## Exam Highlights {.smaller}

-- This is an individual exam 

-- With the exception of major emergencies, late submissions will not be accepted. A last-minute technical issue is not a major emergency.

-- Turn in via PDF. If you fail to do so, we will grade your latest commit and issue a penalty

-- Include appropriate labels, titles, etc. when making any plot

-- Clarification questions are welcome. Debuging is not

-- Cite any code you obtain outside of the course materials

-- **Pull, Commit, Push** often (after every question)

-- Look at what's rendered!


## Goals

-- group_by 

-- mutate

-- summarize

-- Pivots

-- Joins

-- Relationship Discussion


## Join vs Pivot{.smaller}

-- Join (2 data sets) vs Pivot (1 data set)

-- Many ways to join data sets vs Two ways to pivot data 


## Join practice

-- In the `exam-review.qmd`, join our two fake data sets using `left_join`, `right_join`, and `full_join`. Take note of the differences in the resulting output.


## Pivot Wider and Longer

With a wide structure, each person (observational unit) has one observation (row) and a separate column contains data for each measurement. With a long structure, each person (observational unit) has multiple observations; one measurement per row.

## Steps (Long to Wide)

-- What values should make new columns?

-- Where do the values should go in those new columns?

## The Code

```
babies |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = Year,
    values_from = Mobile
)
```

## Steps (Wide to Long)

-- What columns should be values?

-- What should we name that column?

-- What should we name the new column for the "left over" values?

## The Code 

```
babies |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = !(Country),
    names_to = Year,
    values_to = Mobile
)
```


## The code - other arguments {.smaller}

-- pivot_longer 

- `names_transform` - changes variable type 

- `values_drop_na` - drop rows that contain only NA's.
