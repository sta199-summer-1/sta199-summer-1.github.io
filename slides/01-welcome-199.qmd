# What is data science?

## What is data science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science."*

[-Donoho, 2017](doi:10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734)

## Examples of data science

-   Identification and prediction of disease
-   Targeted advertising
-   Supply chain optimization
-   Sports recruitment + strategist
-   The list goes on and on.....

# Our Course

## Our Classroom

-   Community
-   Communication
-   Respect


## Course objectives

-   Learn to explore, visualize, and analyze data in a *reproducible* and *shareable* manner

-   Gain experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization

-   Work on problems and case studies inspired by and based on *real-world questions* and data

-   Learn to *effectively communicate* results through written assignments and final project presentation

## Workflow

Before Class

-   Watch lecture content videos (will locate these during website tour)

-   Clone the application exercise (can be done right before class; we will practice this today)

During Class

-   Warm up question

-   Mix of lecture and live coding 


## Website 

[sta199-summer-1.github.io/](https://sta199-summer-1.github.io/)


# Course Website Tour


# Slack Tour


# Please bring your laptops if able


## Activities and assessments {.smaller}

-   **Homework:** Individual assignments combining conceptual and computational skills.

-   **Labs:** Individual or team assignments focusing on computational skills.

-   **Exams:** Two take-home exams.

-   **Final Project:** Team project presented during the final exam period.

-   **Application Exercises:** Exercises worked on during the live lecture session.

## Application Exercises 

- Are not graded for the first week

- Turned in on GitHub (You will have this ability after Lab-0)

- What is due is what we get through in-class 


## Lab

-   Run by TA Pritam Dey

-   Focus on computing using R tidyverse syntax

-   Apply concepts from lecture to case study scenarios

-   Work on labs individually or in teams of 3 - 4

## Textbooks and readings

-   R for Data Science by Grolemund & Wickham (2nd ed. O'Reilly)

-   Introduction to Modern Statistics by Cetinkaya-Rundel & Hardin (1st ed. OpenIntro)


# Questions? 


# Why learn the technology we do?

## R + R-studio (Posit)

-- Specialization in data visualization

-- Computing tools to fit models

-- Well respected

-- You can take these skills with you

-   The language has grown significantly in popularity and is now used in a range of professions including software development, business analysis, statistical reporting and scientific research

## Create a GitHub account (Why?)

GitHub, Inc., is an Internet hosting service for software development and **version control**. ![](images/01-welcome-199/pnas.png){fig-align="center"}

## What we need to do (5 min)

-- If you have not set up: 

- GitHub Account 

- Slack Account 

- Reserved a Duke Container 

## Create a GitHub account {.smaller}

Please do this before the *Getting to know you* survey

Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one).

Some tips from Happy Git with R.

-- Incorporate your actual name!

-- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e. g., Twitter or Slack.

-- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

-- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.

-- Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).

Invite Example
:::

## Slack

![](images/01-welcome-199/slack.png)

https://slack.com/get-started#/createnew

## R-Studio

-- Reserve a STA198-1991 RStudio container

-- Go to https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers

-- Click Reserve Container for the STA198-199 container


# To much talking.... let's take a break (10 min)

# Meet The Tool-Kit + Data Visualization 

## ae-01

-- We will clone this from GitHub here: https://github.com/sta199-summer-1/ae-01-summer

-- You will do this every day before class & with homework & with labs

-- You will not have the capability to "push changes" to GitHub (yet... this will happen during your first lab!)

## Cloning Demo

## Some R essentials

-- **Functions** are (normally) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:

![](images/02-Meeting-the-toolkit/function.png){width="900" height="100" fig-align="right"}

## R essentials

-- **Packages** are installed with the install.packages function and loaded with the **library** function, once per session:

![](images/02-Meeting-the-toolkit/packages.png){width="900" height="100" fig-align="left"}

## Packages

![](images/02-Meeting-the-toolkit/error1.png){width="900" height="100" fig-align="center"}

`library(tidyverse)`

::: {.column width="60%"}
-- The **tidyverse** is a collection of R packages designed for data science.

-- All packages share an underlying philosophy and a common grammar.

## Quarto

-- an open-source scientific and technical publishing system

-- publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more

-- Code goes in chunks, defined by three backticks, narrative goes outside of chunks

## How will we use Quarto?

-- Every assignment / lab / project will be given to you as a Quarto document

-- You will always have a Quarto template document to start with

-- As we get more familiar with R, the more code you will construct on your own

## The process

`mtcars`

You want to create a visualization. The first thing we need to do is set up the canvas...

## The process

|     `mtcars |>`
|         `ggplot()`

![](images/04-Visualizing-various-types-of-data/canvas.jpg){width="400" height="400" fig-align="center"}

## The process

|     `mtcars |>`
|         `ggplot(`
|         `aes(`
|              `x = variable.name, y = variable.name)`
|                `)`

aes: describe how variables in the data are mapped to your canvas

## The process

`+` "and"

When working with ggplot functions, we will add to our canvas using `+`

## The process

|     `mtcars |>`
|         `ggplot(`
|         `aes(`
|              `x = variable.name, y = variable.name)`
|                `)` +
|         `geom_point()`

## Summary 

-- There area lot of moving parts in this course 

-- Coding is not learned in a day 

-- Ask questions often 

-- What is version control? Why is it important?

-- What is R vs RStudio?

-- What is Quarto?

-- Starting to work with code!
