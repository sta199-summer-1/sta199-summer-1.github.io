# Checklist {.smaller}

-- Have a GitHub account and have it connected with R (Lab 0)

-- Have checked the GitHub username sheet

-- Keeping up with the **Prepare** link on course website

-- Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-f22-2) and find your `ae-02-starwars` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name). -- Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo

## Goals for today

-- Think about what to do (and not to do) with visualizations

-- Understand the fundamentals of ggplot

-- Build appropriate visualizations

-- More practice with R

## Announcements

-- Turn in AE's via GitHub (will go over today)

-- Will turn in Lab 1 via GitHub (Thursday)

-- Release HW 1 Wednesday (Turned in on Gradescope: Being set up now)

## Prepare Reading Questions

## Reading Highlights

-- Sometimes you'll run the code and nothing happens. Check the left-hand of your console: if it's a +, it means that R doesn't think you've typed a complete expression and it's waiting for you to finish it.

## **Examining data visualization** {.smaller}

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(countdown)
```

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Discuss the following for the visualization.

-- What is the visualization trying to show?

-- What is effective, i.e. what is done well?

-- What is ineffective, i.e. what could be improved?

-- What are you curious about after looking at the visualization?

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 4, left = 0, color_text = "#325b74")
```

# Application exercise

## `ae-02-starwars`

-   Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-f22-2) and find your `ae-02-starwars` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name).
-   Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo, and follow along and complete the exercises.
-   Render, commit, and push your edits by the AE deadline -- 3 days from today (Thursday by 11:59p ET).

## Exercises 2.3.1

## Match the variables to plots

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-- 1 categorical variable, 1 quantitative variable (often ordinal)

-- 2 quantitative variables

-- 1 quantitative variable

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 4, left = 0, color_text = "#325b74")
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-- geom_histogram

-- geom_point

-- geom_bar

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-- Construct plots with `ggplot()`.

-- Layers of ggplots are separated by `+`s.

-- The formula is (almost) always as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(DATA, aes(x = X-VAR, y = Y-VAR, ...)) +
  geom_XXX()
```

-- Aesthetic attributes of a geometries (color, size, transparency, etc.) can be **map**ped to variables in the data or **set** by the user.

-- Use `facet_wrap()` when faceting (creating small multiples) by one variable and `facet_grid()` when faceting by two variables.
