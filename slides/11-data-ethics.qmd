-- What questions do you have?

-- What do you wonder?

## The Study

-- 5 men and 11 women showed up, aged 19 to 67.

-- Frank randomly assigned the subjects to one of three diet groups. One group followed a low-carbohydrate diet. Another followed the same low-carb diet plus a daily 1.5 oz. bar of dark chocolate. And the rest, a control group, were instructed to make no changes to their current diet.

-- They weighed themselves each morning for 21 days, and the study finished with a final round of questionnaires and blood tests.

## The Great Chocolate Hoak

"If you measure a large number of things about a small number of people, you are almost guaranteed to get a "statistically significant" result. Our study included 18 different measurements---weight, cholesterol, sodium, blood protein levels, sleep quality, well-being, etc.---from 15 people. . . ."

"It was, in fact, a fairly typical study for the field of diet research. Which is to say: It was terrible science. The results are meaningless, and the health claims that the media blasted out to millions of people around the world are utterly unfounded."

## Original study {.smaller}

Moore, Steven C., et al. [**"Association of leisure-time physical activity with risk of 26 types of cancer in 1.44 million adults."**](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2521826) JAMA internal medicine 176.6 (2016): 816-825.

-   **Volunteers** were **asked** about their physical activity level over the preceding year.
-   Half exercised less than about 150 minutes per week, half exercised more.
-   Compared to the bottom 10% of exercisers, the top 10% had lower rates of esophageal, liver, lung, endometrial, colon, and breast cancer.
-   Researchers found no association between exercising and 13 other cancers (e.g. pancreatic, ovarian, and brain).

## The Takeaway

-- Be a skeptic

-- Ask questions

-- Let the data tell the story, don't tell the data for the story

-- Most studies should not claim causality

# Telling a story {.smaller}

-- What does this graph represent?

-- What are the story of these data?

-- Is the graph misleading?

-- How could you improve this graph?

## How woul you fix this graph?

  geom_line() +
  geom_label(aes(label = cost), hjust = -0.25) +

# Visualising uncertainty

## What is uncertainty?

-- "How sure are you of your conclusions?"

## What is uncertainty?

There are many reasons why a data analysis might still leave us in a position of uncertainty

-- We don't have population data

-- Measurement error

-- Reporting error

## Quick Example {.smaller}

![](images/10-data-ethics/coin-flip.png){width="400" height="400" fig-align="center"}

-   Flip 1: Heads
-   Flip 2: Heads
-   Flip 3: Tails
-   Flip 4: Heads

Suppose a researcher was interested in how diet impacted chicken weight? They assigned 5 chickens to 1 of 4 different diets. Here are the reported median weights of the 4 groups of chickens:

-- Diet 1: 160 grams

-- Diet 2: 225 grams

-- Diet 3: 280 grams

-- Diet 4: 245 grams

-   So Diet 4 causes heavier chickens? Other reasons?

```{r}
#| echo: false

catalan <- tibble(
  response = c("No", "Yes", "No answer"),
  rate     = c(45.3, 44.5, 10.2)
) %>%
  mutate(response = fct_relevel(response, "No", "Yes", "No answer"))

ggplot(catalan, aes(y = fct_rev(response), x = rate, color = response, group = response)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = rate, 
                   y = fct_rev(response), yend = fct_rev(response)),
               size = 1) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#5C8AA9", "#9D303A", "gray")) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +
  labs(
    title = "Do you want Catalonia\nto become an independent state?",
    caption = "",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  )
```

So the answer is No! .... No?

#| echo: false
catalan <- catalan %>%
  mutate(
    low = rate - 2.95,
    high = rate + 2.95

  geom_segment(aes(x = low, xend = high, 
                   y = fct_rev(response), yend = fct_rev(response)),

  geom_point(size = 3) +

  scale_x_continuous(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +
  labs(
    title = "Do you want Catalonia\nto become an independent state?",
    caption = "The probability of the tiny difference between the\n'No' and 'Yes' being just due to random chance is very high.",
    x = NULL, y = NULL
  )
