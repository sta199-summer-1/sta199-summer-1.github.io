## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-22`

-- Lab 9 Due Tuesday (April 11th)

-- HW-6 (Statistics Experience) due April 28th

-- Project Draft Report due Friday (April 7th)

-- HW 5 Due Thursday (April 13th)  

-- Good Conversation in Slack! Check it out

-- Second Peer Evaluation (April 10th)

-- Exam 2 starts April 14th

## Research Participation 

-- Research team creating an intro data science assessment

-- We would like to have students in an intro data science course take the assessment

-- Pin down how students think about things so that we can better phrase our questions

-- Located at the end of HW 5 

-- Your responses matter!

## Project Announcement  

-- Include literature review in report 

## Lab - Peer Review 

-- Will provide feedback via `issues` tab on 2 projects 

-- Attendance will be taken to track participation 

-- If you can not attend, you are expected to create a separate `issue` tab and provide additional feedback

## Warm Up{.smaller}

$\mu_s = \mu_v$

$\mu_s \neq \mu_v$

Please write out an appropriate interpretation, decision, and conclusion in the context of the problem.


## Goals for Today 

-- Use theory methods for 1 categorical explanatory 1 quantitative response 

-- Use permutation and theory methods for 2 categorical variables 

## Standardized Statistic 

Standardized test statistics are used in hypothesis testing

Standardized test statistic: (statistic - null value)/(standard error of the statistic).

Standardized test statistics are a way for you to compare your results to a “normal” distribution of statistics.

The standardized test statistic represents the number of SEs your statistic is away from the center of the null distribution.

## Two Categorical Variables

-- What is our parameter of interest in proper notation?

-- What is our sample statistic in proper notation?

## Two Categorical Variables 

-- $\pi_1 - \pi_2$

-- $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$

## Two Categorical Variables 

-- Our parameters and statistic change

-- We model our statistic using a normal distribution 


## Wrap Up 

We can calculate confidence intervals and conduct hypothesis tests for a combination of categorical and quantitative variables
