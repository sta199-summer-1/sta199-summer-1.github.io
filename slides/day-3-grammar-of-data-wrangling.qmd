## Checklist

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
```

-- Clone ae-03-summer-your-user-name using the SSH key

Note: if you do not see an ae-03 specifically for you, you have not accepted your org invite


## Announcements 

-- AE's are being graded: We will demo how to turn AE's in today

-- Keep up to date with Slack


## Goals for today

-- Finish off data visualization

-- Introduce `dplyr` functions

-- Continue R practice 

## Warm up

Identify which plot each`geom` creates 

-- `geom_point()`

-- `geom_density()`

-- `geom_boxplot()`

-- `geom_bar()`


## Warm Up #2 

What is the difference beweteen `|>` and `+` ? 

## Warm Up #3 

|`penguins |>`
|  `ggplot(` 
|       `aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species )) +`
|       `geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, alpha = 0.3)`

# Types of variables 

## Types of variables 

Type is how an object is stored in memory.

-- `glimpse` is a great way to check data types 

-- Can also use `typeof()`

## Examples 

-- `glimpse(mtcars)`

-- `typeof(mtcars$mpg)`

## Types of variables 

Some of the types of variables include: 

-- "logical" 

-- "integer" 

-- "double" 

-- "character" 

-- "factor"

## logical 

-- `logi` in `glimpse`

-- The logical data type in R is also known as boolean data type. It can only have two values: TRUE and FALSE. <br>

-- `as.logical` can turn a variable into a logical. `False` = 0; `True` everything else

## integer 

-- `int` in `glimpse` 

-- Integers are whole numbers (those numbers without a decimal point)

-- `as.integer` can turn a double into an integer. Forces 22.8 -> 22. 

## double 

-- `dbl` in `glimpse`

-- Real numbers (can include decimals)

-- `as.double`can force a column to be a double. Identical to `as.numeric`. 

## character 

-- `chr` in `glimpse`

-- Character string (text)

-- `as.character` attempts to coerce its argument to character type

## factor

-- `fct` in `glimpse`

-- Factor in R is also known as a categorical variable that stores both string and integer data values as **levels**.

-- `factor` attempts to coerce its argument to factor type

## Why this matters 

-- Plotting 

-- Summary statistics 

## General takeaways 

-- Can you identify variable types 

-- Often need to turn something into a factor to make it categorical 

-- Often need to turn something into a double (numeric) to make it quantitative 

# More on this later

## Today's live coding topic (Data Manipulation)

## Data Manipulation 

-- Want to subset 

-- Want to manipulate 

-- Want to create 

... from data 

# ae-03

## Wrap up 

-- Data types matter. Get in the habit of checking them at the beginning of analysis 

-- Have the tools to create new variables, calculate summary statistics, etc. that accompany strong visualizations 

-- Have the tools to manipulate data to be in a more usable format
