-   Methodology: include visualizations and summary statistics relevant to your research question. You should also justify the choice of statistical method(s) used to answer your research question.

-   Results: Provide only the main results from your analysis.

-   Abstract: An abstract is a concise summary of a research paper / project. An abstract lets readers get the gist or essence of your paper or article quickly. Search for a research paper to get the gist of it (https://scholar.google.com/).

## Hints {.smaller}

-- Reference the AEs and Videos for example research questions

-- Write yourself a project outline

-   What is the topic?

-   Why do we care?

-   What are we interested in?

# ae-19 - Bootstrap

## In Summary

-   Bootstrap methods are simulation methods

-   Variability - *Uncertainty*: How spread out your data are

-   We can use this to guess plausible values around our parameter of interest

-   This is called a confidence interval, and it's different than probability
