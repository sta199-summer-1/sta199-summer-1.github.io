-- Will guide warm up questions for Thursday 


## Warm up

Please define the following...

-- `select()`

-- `slice()`

-- `arrange()`

## Warm up (2) 

We glossed over this on Monday.... it needs more attention!

We can string multiple pipes together. That's the purpose of tidyverse!

```
flights |> 
  select(tailnum, carrier, dep_delay) |>
  arrange(desc(dep_delay)) |>
  slice(1) 
```


## Render Discussion 

Why can't I Render? 

-- Error in your code?

-- Duplicate code chunk label? 

-- Are you using a function that brings up an external panel such as `View()`?

## GitHub Discussion 

Why are my changes not showing up in GitHub? 

-- Are you in the right project? 

You can see the project you are working in in the top right corner of your screen. This MUST be the project that you cloned for the exam / assignment / lab. Do not use the files tab to go search for a file outside of your project repo.

## Tibble vs Data Frame in R

In the console, type `mtcars` in the data set

Now, type `as_tibble(mtcars)`

## TIbble vs Data Frame in R 

-- A tibble is often considered a neater format of a data frame

-- Tibble has a more advanced print function

-- Tidyverse functions are built to work with tibbles

## Goals

-- Play with `dplyr` functions

-- Understand join functions

-- Join multiple data frames

# ae-04

## Motivation 

Messy data

-- The sheer volume of information is sometimes referred to as “messy” data, because it's hard to make sense of it all.

# How? 

## Joining datasets

**Data merging** is the process of combining two or more data sets into a single data set. Most often, this process is necessary when you have raw data stored in multiple files, worksheets, or data tables, that you want to analyze together.

## Joining datasets 

-- Left Join 

-- Inner Join 

-- Right Join 

-- Full Join

## AE-04

-- ae-04 part 2! 

-- Joining Fisheries

## Recap of AE

-- This is important! Data are messy!

-- Think carefully about the join you use
