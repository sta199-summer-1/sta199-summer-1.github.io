You can see the project you are working in in the top right corner of your screen. This MUST be the project that you cloned for the exam / assignment / lab. Do not use the files tab to go search for a file outside of your project repo.



## Goals

-- Understand join functions

-- Join multiple data frames

## Motivation 

Messy data

-- The sheer volume of information is sometimes referred to as “messy” data, because it's hard to make sense of it all.

# How? 

## Joining datasets

**Data merging** is the process of combining two or more data sets into a single data set. Most often, this process is necessary when you have raw data stored in multiple files, worksheets, or data tables, that you want to analyze together.

## Joining datasets 

-- Left Join 

-- Inner Join 

-- Right Join 

-- Full Join
