## Checklist

-- Clone `exam-2-review-s23`

-- HW-6 (Statistics Experience) due April 28th

-- Project Final Report (April 28th)

-- Project Presentations (April 25th)

-- Second Peer Evaluation (April 14th by 5:00 PM)

-- Exam 2 starts April 14th at 5:00 PM

-- Good Conversation in Slack! Check it out

## Early AEs

-- If you have unstaged changes.... go back and push them

## Project Clarifications

Methodology

-- The methodology section should include visualizations and summary statistics relevant to your research question. You should also justify the choice of **statistical method(s)** used to answer your research question.

-- EDA is not a statistical method

-- Fitting a model; hypothesis test; confidence interval

## Exam Rules

Same as Exam 1

-- Individual Exam: Don't Cheat

-- Clarification Questions on Slack in #exam-2 channel

-- Questions are cumulative with a focus on Unit 2

-- No Lab Tuesday (April 18th)

-- Exam Due 11:59 (April 18th)

## Warm Up: Discussion

Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests are related.... here's how

## Warm Up:

-- (1 - $\alpha$)100% Confidence Interval

Confidence Interval: statistic $\pm$ z\* x $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt(n)}$

Hypothesis Test: $\frac{statistic - null}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt(n)}}$

The standard deviation (spread) of the distribution is the same.

## Warm Up

## Takeaway

A 95% confidence interval is **associated** with a two-sided hypothesis test at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level

## Goals Today

-- Review

We have covered a lot

This review is going to focus on confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing

These are not all that we've covered as it not meant to be an exhaustive review

## Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing

-- What do they help us accomplish?

## Confidence Intervals

-- Help us **estimate** the population parameter of interest

-- Gives us plausible values of what our population parameter could be

So what is our population parameter?

## Population Parameter

-- The variables we are interested in dictate our population parameter and sample statistic

-- Single Quantitative Variable: $\mu$

-- Single Categorical Variable: $\pi$

-- Categorical Explanatory and Quantitative Response: $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

-- Categorical Explanatory and Categorical Response: $\pi_1 - \pi_2$

## Sample Statistic

-- Single Quantitative Variable: $\bar{x}$

-- Single Categorical Variable: $\hat{p}$

-- Categorical Explanatory and Quantitative Response: $\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}$

-- Categorical Explanatory and Categorical Response: $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$

## Simulation Methods or Theory Methods?

-- Both need **Independence**

-- Theory methods (CLT) has a more strict sample size assumption that needs to be met as well

-- These sample size assumptions change based on the variables we are working with

## Single Mean (Chapter 19)

-- n \> 30

## Single Proportion (Chapter 16)

-- Observe at least 10 successes and 10 failures

## Categorical Explanatory; Quantitative Response (Chapter 20)

-- $n_1$ \> 30

-- $n_2$ \> 30

## Categorical Explanatory; Categorical Response (Chapter 17)

-- Observe at least 10 successes and 10 failures in each group

## Making the confidence interval

-- statistic $\pm$ t/z-score \* SE(statistic)

The standard error of the statistic changes depending on the statistic!

## t/z-score

-- `qt`

-- `qnorm`

## Simulation

-- Bootstrap

-- Use our data to create a distribution centered at our sample statistic

## Hypothesis Testing

-- Null Hypothesis

-- Alternative Hypothesis

## Hypothesis Testing

-- Null Hypothesis - what we assume about the population parameter

-- Alternative Hypothesis - the research question we ask

## Example:

In the exam review, we will be looking at a roller coaster and amusement park database by Duane Marden. This database records multiple features of roller coasters. For the purpose of this activity, we will work with a random sample of 157 roller coasters.

We are interested in investigating if roller coasters after 1970 are faster than those opened before. For this question, we want to test for a difference. Assume speed is measured in mph.

## Theory Based

$\frac{statistic - null}{se(statistic)}$

The standard error of the statistic changes based on the statistic

## Simulation

One categorical case: "draw"

One quantitative case: "shifted bootstrap"

When we have groups.... Permute!

-- Shuffle our data to create null distribution

## The Process After

-- Find our statistic on the distribution

-- Shade in the appropriate area

-- Compare p-value to $\alpha$

-- Write a decision (context of the null)

-- Write a conclusion (context of the alternative)

-- Can interpret p-value (use definition)
