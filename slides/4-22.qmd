## Presentation Grading {.smaller}

-- Content: Is the research question well designed and are the data being used relevant to the research question? Did the team use appropriate statistical procedures and interpret their results accurately?

-- Creativity and critical thought: Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into planning and implementation of the project?

-- Slides: Are the slides well organized, legible, not full of text, featuring figures with legible labels, legends, etc.?

-- Teamwork and professionalism: Did the team present a unified story as opposed to independent pieces of work patched together? Did they present well? Does the presentation appear to be well-practiced? Are they reading off of a script in a way that suggests they don't know what they're saying? Did everyone get a chance to say something meaningful about the project?

-- Time management: Did the team stay within 5 minutes for their presentation? Did they divide the the time well amongst themselves in a way that every team member got a fair share of the time?

## Goals for today

-- Finish AE-24 material (in AE-25)

-- Introduction to Spatial Data Analysis + Map Making 

# Spatial Data 

## Spatial Modeling Overview 

Researchers in many fields are faced with analyzing data with a spatial component. These analyses typically include:

-- modeling trends and correlation structures

-- estimation of underlying model parameters

-- hypothesis testing or model comparison

-- prediction of observations at unobserved times or locations

## Example

## Spatial Data Visualization Tools 

There are many tools for creating spatial figures (GIS software, Tableau, etc…), but we will exclusively use R and the wide range of packages within it.

In particular, we will use:

- `ggplot2`

- `leaflet` 

- and more.... 

If a tab comes up to install packages, do so.

Click install in the tab or use install.packages(“package.name”)
