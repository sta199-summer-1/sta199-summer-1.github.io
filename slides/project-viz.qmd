## Announcements {.smaller}

-- Clone ae-24

-- Exam 2 is over. You did it :)

-- HW-6 (Statistics Experience) due April 28th

-- Project Final Report (April 28th)

-- Project Presentations (April 25th)

-- Third Peer Evaluation Coming (Dates announced soon)

## Regrade Requests

-- Once grades are changed on Gradescope, they will not be reflected in Sakai Gradebook

## Grading Announcements

-- Drop lowest HW (This can be a HW that you have earned a 0 on)

-- Drop lowest Lab

-- 80% of the AEs pushed -\> earning 100%

# Project

## Project

-- Contribute! Communicate!

You are not guaranteed to earn the same grade as your project peers

--- Peer Evaluations

--- Lab participation

--- TA input

## Project

-- You are expected to be in lab on April 28th. If there is an extreme circumstance, please get your Dean involved.

-- The presentation must be no longer than 5 minutes. You can choose to present live in class (recommended) or pre-record a video to be shown in class.

-- I will have a computer hooked up for presenting. I will pull up your presentation from your hosted website.

-- Each individual is expected to be engaged when others are presenting.

## Expectations of the report

Check `project description` on our website

-- Introduction

-- Literature Review

-- Methods

-- Results

-- Discussions

## Methods

This section includes any exploratory data analysis and a brief description of your statistical procedure.

In this section, explore your data and justify the procedures you will be using to answer your research question.

## Results

Make it look like a report. Before you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option `echo: false` in the YAML

Discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis

The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions

## Penguins Example

(3 min): Interested in looking at the relationship between flipper length and bill length. I don't want to interpret it.....So why did I include body_mass?

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidymodels)

linear_reg() |>
  set_engine("lm") |>
  fit(flipper_length_mm ~ bill_length_mm + body_mass_g, data = penguins) |>
  tidy()

```

## Suggestions

Your report should tell a story!

-- What are you interested in finding out?

-- What have others done that is *related to what you are interested in*

-- How did you explore data in relation to your research question?

-- How are you attempting to answer your research question?

-- Limitations things to consider with what you found out?

## Presentation Suggestions

-- Try not to fill your slides up with words

-- Well-organized

-- Know your audience (we know nothing about your project)

## Presentation Suggestions {.smaller}

Get excited about showing off your hard work!

-- Things to consider when presenting....

-   Well designed research question?

-   Appropriate statistical procedures and/or interpretations to answer the question?

-   Any limitations considered?

-   Are slides professional? Is your presentation professional?

-   Time management.

## Presentation Creation

-- Google Slides

-- Quarto (if you like!)

-- Will have Google sheet to paste slide link into prior to your presentation

# Communicating Visualizations Effectively

## Warm Up

How do we effectively communicate data?

## Goals for today

-- Go over plotting techniques to make visualizations better

-- Review Quarto customization tools

-- AE-24

## AE-24

-- Go over what we've learned

-- Introduce new code

**You are not suppose to be able to write this code without help! Use this ae as a guide / reference**

Play around with the code to learn about the functionality
