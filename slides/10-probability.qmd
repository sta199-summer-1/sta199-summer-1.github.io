## Checklist

-- Exam-1 is over! Congratulations on your hard work 

-- Clone ae-09

-- HW-2 coming **FRIDAY**

## Feedback 

-- HW's, labs, AE's and exam; there are a lot of submissions to keep track of

-- I wish there was a cheat sheet for all the appropriate formatting for our HWs and labs.

-- Structure of ae's (i.e. consistently not finishing ae material in class)	

-- I think that sometimes it would be helpful to do a quick review in the lecture of what we've learned the class before. 

## Where we are going 

$\checkmark$ Data Viz 

-- Probability 

-- Modeling Data 

## Goals

- have a working understanding of the terms probability, sample space, event, population and sample.

- compute probabilities of events from data

- create a contingency table using pivot_wider() and kable()

- use a contingency table to explore the relationship between two categorical variables.

## Probability 

-- The probability of **an event** tells us how likely an event is to occur 

- takes on values from 0 to 1

- the proportion of times the event would occur if it could be observed an infinite number of times

- our degree of belief an event will happen

## An Event 

-- is the basic element to which probability is applied, e.g. the result of an observation or experiment

- Example: A is the event a student in STA 199 is a sophomore

- We use capital letters, e.g. A to denote events

## The oppositve of the Event 

-- If A is the event a student in STA199 is a sophomore, what is the opposite? 

- For any event A and its **complement** is $A^c$

- Can think about *c* as "not"

- Pr(A) + Pr($A^c$) = 1

## Sample Space

-- A sample space is the set of all possible outcomes

- Each outcome in the sample space is disjoint or mutually exclusive meaning they canâ€™t occur simultaneously

## Sample Space

-- The sample space for year in school is....?

- {Freshman, Sophmore, Junior, Senior}

-  each item brackets is a distinct outcome

- The probability of the entire sample space is 1

## Example 

Suppose you are interested in the probability of landing on heads. 

Define the following: 

- Event (and compliment)

- Sample space

## More Complicated Probabilities 

-- And 

-- Or 

-- Conditional 

## Conditional Probabilities 

-- "Given an event has already happened....."

-- A | B

-- Cuts up our contingency table
