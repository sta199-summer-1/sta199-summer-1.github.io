## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-13`

## Data Fest 2023 at Duke {.smaller}

-- data analysis competition where teams of up to five students attack a large, complex, and surprise dataset over a weekend

-- DataFest is a great opportunity to gain experience that employers are looking for

-- Each team will give a brief presentation of their findings that will be judged by a panel of judges comprised of faculty and professionals from a variety of fields.

## Announcements

-- HW-3 Due Wednesday: March 8th (11:59)

-- Lab 4 due Tuesday March 7th (11:59)

-- Project Proposal due Friday: March 10th (11:59)

--- 1 submission. Attach everyone to it

## Project Highlights

-- The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing.

-- The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

## Project Highlights

-- A project proposal with three dataset ideas.

-- A reproducible project writeup of your analysis, with one required draft along the way.

-- Formal peer review on another team's project.

-- A presentation with slides.

## Project Turn-In

You will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues (more on this in a future lab) that you need to engage with and close.

## Project Repo

You have a team project repo to work in. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website.

## For your proposal

-- 3 data sets that you find interesting

-- One research question for each

-- Literature 

-- `glimpse` of data 


## Goals

More with modeling

-- Model with multiple predictors

## Warm Up

What is the difference between an interaction model and an additive model?

:::

## ae-13

-- Start ae-13

-- Fit the interaction model between island, flipper length, and body mass in R

## Interaction with 2 Quan Xs

## R-squared (coefficient of determination)

-- How much variability in Y is explained by our model

## Variability

"How spread out your data are"

![](images/var.png)

## R-squared (coefficient of determination)

$\frac{Sums of Square Total - Sums of Square Residuals}{Sums of Square Total}$

# Draw it out (SLR Case)

## Model Summary

-- Reveal Patterns not evident in graphs

-- BUT ... can also impose structures that are not really there.....

-- General Rule:

--- Be a skeptic

--- Fit an appropriate model

## In Summary

-- SLR vs MLR

-- Additive vs Interaction

-- Predict

-- Interpret

## Moving Forward

-- How do we choose our "best" model?

-- What is the response variable is categorical?
