## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-15`

-- Homework 4 is Live (Due 6-26)

-- Project Report Draft Due Tonight

-- Lab Today is a Project Work Day

-- Group Feedback Survey-2 in Sakai Coming Today

-- Instructor Evaluations 

## Evaluations (5-10 minutes)

-- Please go to: `eval-duke.evaluationkit.com.`  

-- I take these seriously 

-- Duke takes these seriously 

## By the way... 

You have been my favorite summer session to teach...

## Project Talk: Rough Draft 

The draft and peer review will focus primarily on the exploratory data analysis and initial interpretations.

-- Write the draft in the report.qmd 

-- Make sure you are Building your entire website (demo)

-- Change author information 


## Project Talk: Rough Draft 

-- Introduction and data (incorporate feedback / add missing details)

-- Methodology

    +  include visualizations and summary statistics relevant to your research question

    +  justify the choice of statistical method(s) used to answer your research question

-- Results

    + Provide the main results from your analysis
    

## Typical Feedback / Questions 

-- Do your methods actually answer your research question? 

-- Do you have the data to answer your research question? 

-- Did you consider including any other variables in your model? (modeling question)


## Presentation 

-- The presentation should be between 5-15 minutes

-- Short QA after

-- Record presentation part if you can not make it due to an extreme circumstance + follow up with an email I send of questions 

-- Use whatever platform you are most comfortable with. Google slides is recommended for collaboration 

## Presentation Tips{.smaller}

-- More plots; Less words 

-- Make sure the audience understands..

    + Why 
    
    + What your research question is 
    
-- Your plots are distracting if your labels are hard to read. Make them bigger than you think you need on your slides! 

-- Don't read from slides. You are welcome to note cards (but don't just read from those either)

-- Everyone needs to contribute something meaningful 

-- Practice 


# Questions? 

## Warm Up

-- Why do we make confidence intervals? What is the purpose of confidence intervals? 

-- Where are bootstrap distributions centered? Why does this make sense? 

## A Review from Last Time 

-- We can use the CLT to create confidence intervals (last-ae) and conduct hypothesis tests (this-ae)

-- The CLT states for a sufficiently large sample from the population, the distribution of the sample statistic will be approximately normally distributed

-- Which we need for our statistical inference methods 

## Assumptions 

-- Independence 

-- Large sample size 

## Large sample size 

Quantitative Response 

-- n > 30 (in each group if multiple)

-- At least 10 successes and 10 failures (in each group if multiple)

## Last Time: 

Pokemon Heights 

estimate $\pm$ Margin of Error 

Margin of error = $t_{df}^* * \frac{s}{\sqrt(n)}$ 

## Today: Difference in Means

## Hypothesis Testing using CLT

-- First, we need to standardize our estimate

Standardized test statistic: (statistic - null value)/(standard error of the statistic).

Standardized test statistics are a way for you to compare your results to a “normal” distribution of statistics


## Hypothesis Testing using CLT

Then use `pt` to calculate the p-value!

## The Categorical Cases 

-- Chapter [16](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-one-prop.html) and [17](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-two-props.html) 

## The Categorical Cases (Confidence Intervals)

-- Very similar to what we have done 

![](images/pme.png){}

-- Notice the $z^*$ instead of the $t*$

## The Categorical Cases (Hypothesis Testing)

-- Very similar to what we have done
