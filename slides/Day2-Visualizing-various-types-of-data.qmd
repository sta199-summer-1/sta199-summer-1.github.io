## Goals for today

Create plots!

-- Understand `geoms`

-- Scatterplots, boxplots, histograms, etc

-- Practice with the fundamentals of ggplot

## Tips and Tricks

-- Let the types of variables dictate the plot

-- Informative title

-- Axes should be labeled

-- Careful consideration of aesthetic choices (like color)

## Warm Up Questions

Why is the following code so important?

1. `library(tidyverse)`

2. What word do we associate with `|>` ?

## Warm Up Questions{.smaller}

Let's practice reading code as a sentence

|     `mtcars |>`
|         `ggplot(`
|         `aes(`
|              `x = mpg, y = wt)`
|                `)` +
|         `geom_point()`

Q2

|       `mtcars |>`
|           `summarize(med = median(wt))`



## Single Pipeline 

Goal: Calculate the mean weight of cards over 4000 lbs.

Good: 

|   `mtcars |>`
|       `filter(wt > 4) |>`
|       `summarize(avg = mean(wt))`

Not as good: 

|   `large_cars <- mtcars |>`
|         `filter(wt > 4)`
|  
|   `large_cars |>` 
|         `summarize(avg = mean(wt))`

## geom reference

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

**A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend; they use the point geom.**


## We can make plots.... 

But how do we talk about them? 

## General Rules 

-- Look for patterns 

-- Look at `shape` 

-- Look for outliers or anything unusual 

-- Look for `spread` of the data

## Shape

We often talk about skew when describing shape of data

-- Positive Skew (Right Skew)

-- Negative Skew (Left Skew)

-- Roughlyl Symmentric

![](images/skew.png){fig-align="center"}

## Outliers

A data point that does not follow the general trend of the data

![](images/boxplot.out.png){fig-align="center"}

## Center

-- What's the mean

-- What's the median

## Spread (More Coming Later!)

How spread out things are...

-- Standard deviation

-- IQR

## Useful function of the day 

`names()`

There are many ways we can extract variable names from our data set. I find myself using this a lot in practice.

## ae-02-s23

These data were collected from 2007 - 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network. The data were imported directly from the Environmental Data Initiative (EDI) Data Portal, and are available for use by CC0 license ("No Rights Reserved") in accordance with the Palmer Station Data Policy.

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   Pick geoms based on data types.

-   Manipulate graphs to be more appropriate with arguments

-   Take control of your labels

-   Use color to your advantage. https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html & \n https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html
