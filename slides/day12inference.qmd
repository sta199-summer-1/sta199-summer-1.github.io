## Checklist

-- Clone `ae-12`

-- Homework 3 Due tonight 11:59 (6-13)

-- Lab due Thursday 5:00 (6-15)

--- Issues

-- Group Feedback Survey in Sakai Coming Today (look for announcement)

-- Exam 1 common mistakes to be posted on Slack today 

-- Exam 2: June 15th Start | June 20th due date


## Warm Up

Last class, we fit a model to predict 

![](images/roc-curve.png)


## Warm Up 

Go to ae-12. Go to the roc.qmd

Create your own roc curve using `email_fit2`. 

Compare the predictive performance to `email_fit`. 

Is this new model better? Worse? How can you tell? 

## Statistical Inference 

-- the methods of forming judgments about **population parameters**

## Population Parameters 

-- $\mu$

-- $\pi$

## Population Parameters 

-- $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

-- $\pi_1 - pi_2$

## Motivation 

But.... we don't know what these values are, so we collect data!


## Sample Statistics 

-- $\bar{x}$

-- $\hat{p}$

## Sample Statistics 

-- $\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}$

-- $\hat{p_1} - \hat{p_2}$

## Questions that we will answer 

-- Test to see if our population parameter is different than a value (hypothesis testing)

-- Estimate the value of the population parameter 

and we will use data and the idea of variability to answer these questions


## Today 

We will go through how to conduct a hypothesis test using bootstrapping procedures!

## Bootstrap & Randomization

Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that re samples within a single data set to create many simulated samples.

The term bootstrapping comes from the phrase “pulling oneself up by one’s bootstraps”, which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without any outside help

Randomization is when we randomly shuffle within a single data set to create many simulated samples

## Why

Impossible task: estimating / testing a population parameter using data from only the given sample.

Note: This notion of saying something about a population parameter using only information from an observed sample is the crux of statistical inference.

## Hypothesis Testing 

-- Null hypothesis $H_o:$

-- Alternative hypothesis $H_a:$

## Null hypothesis 

-- Assumes "nothing is going on"

-- Sets a parameter = 0 

-- Sets group equal to each other 

## Alternative hypothesis 

-- This is what we are interested in!

-- We dictate this by the sign of our alternative hypothesis 

## Alternative hypothesis 

-- > 

-- < 

-- $\neq$

## ae-12

-- p-value 

-- significance level 

-- Decisions; Conclusions; Interpretations 

## When can we trust these results? 

-- When the sample we take is representative

**We have a random sample** 

**Sample size is not very small**
