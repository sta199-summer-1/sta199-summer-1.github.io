Moving forward, you will turn in pieces of your project on GitHub. \n-   If you have cloned this already, go to RStudio and open the RStudio project called `final-project`. You can do this by navigating to it from the top right corner of your RStudio window.\n-   Pull to bring in any changes your teammates may have made to the project.\n-   Go to the Build tab and click Render website. Your final project will be displayed here. \n-   Make sure it compiles without errors. View your project website in your Viewer tab.\n\n# Tasks\n\n## Proposal feedback review\n\n\n-   As a team, review all feedback left in Gradescope for your proposal.\n\n-   Make decision about which dataset you will use for your project and going forward write up your analysis in `report.qmd`. Additionally, report which data set you plan to use to your lab instructor.\n\n## Project draft\n\n::: callout-important\nYour next project related deadline is Mon, Nov 7 at 11:59pm.\nYour project draft, written in `report.qmd`, must be pushed to GitHub by that time.\nYou will lose push access to your repo at that time until your draft has been reviewed.\nOnce again, you will receive feedback as issues on your GitHub repository.\n:::\n\n-   Review <https://sta199-f22-2.github.io/project-description.html#draft> for requirements for the project draft.\n-   Start working on your draft! Make good use of the time with your TA during lab.\n-   Once you complete your draft but before you finalize it:\n    -   In `report.qmd` set `echo: false` in the YAML of your document.\n        Read through your draft completely and make sure everything makes sense without the code visible, and make any edits as needed.\n        Then, set `echo: true` again before submitting.\n        (For your draft we want to see your code so we can provide feedback on it. For your final report we will ask you to hide it again.)\n\n    -   Update your `index.qmd`:\n\n        -   Update the `title` field with your team name.\n\n        -   Add your abstract.\n\n    -   Update your About page (`about.qmd`) with information on your team.\n\n## Quarto options\n\n::: callout-note\nMuch of what is listed in this section is optional, but we recommend reviewing them as a team and deciding on which ones you want to use/include in your project.\n:::\n\n### Theming\n\nYou can see your deployed project website at the URL listed in your project repo.\n\n-   You can pick a theme from <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>.\n-   You can update the theme of your project by changing the `theme` field in the `_quarto.yml` file.\n-   Render the website from the Build tab and commit and push your changes.\n\n### Footnotes\n\nTo add a footnote, make sure you're in the Visual editor mode in RStudio and click on Insert \\> Footnote.[^1]\nOne you add your footnote, click outside of the footnote area, anywhere else in your document, to go back to editing your document.\n\n[^1]: Here is a footnote!\n\n### Cross references\n\nYou can add cross references to your figures and tables so that you can refer to them like \"Figure 1 shows that ...\" or \"As seen in Table 1, ...\" instead of \"the figure below\" or \"the table below\".\nTo do this, you need to label the code chunks for those figures and tables in a special way (with `fig-` and `tbl-` suffixes, respectively) and add captions to them.\n\n#### Figures\n\nFor example, @fig-mtcars-plot shows a positive and moderately strong relationship between fuel efficiency of cars (measured as miles/gallon) and their displacement.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| label: fig-mtcars-plot\n#| fig-cap: \"Fuel efficiency of cars vs. their displacement.\"\n\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Fuel efficiency of cars vs. their displacement.](lab-project-draft_files/figure-html/fig-mtcars-plot-1.png){#fig-mtcars-plot width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat you're not seeing in the text above is that we didn't type `Figure 1` in the text, but instead referenced this figure with `@fig-mtcars-plot`:\n\n>     For example, @fig-mtcars-plot shows a positive and moderately strong relationship between fuel efficiency of cars (measured as miles/gallon) and their displacement.\n\n#### Tables\n\nAnd @tbl-mpg-disp shows the output of the linear regression for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\n\nNote that we piped the result of the `tidy()` function (which outputs a tibble) into the `kable()` function from the **knitr** package to turn it into a table.\nQuarto needs this last step to know that this code chunk produces a table that can be formatted and cross referenced as such.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-mpg-disp .cell tbl-cap='Linear regression model for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.'}\n\n````{.cell-code}\n```{{r}}\n#| label: tbl-mpg-disp\n#| tbl-cap: \"Linear regression model for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\"\n\nlinear_reg() |>\n  fit(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars) |>\n  tidy() |>\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n````\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|term        |   estimate| std.error| statistic| p.value|\n|:-----------|----------:|---------:|---------:|-------:|\n|(Intercept) | 29.5998548| 1.2297195| 24.070411|       0|\n|disp        | -0.0412151| 0.0047118| -8.747151|       0|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOnce again, what you're not seeing in the text above is that we didn't type `Table 1` in the text, but instead referenced this table with `@tbl-mpg-disp`.\n\n>     And @tbl-mpg-disp shows the output of the linear regression for predicting fuel efficiency from displacement.\n\n### Citations\n\nYou can use Quarto's built-in citation and bibliography features for your citations.\nFor example ...\n",
