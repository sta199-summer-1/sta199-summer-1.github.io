One group followed a low-carbohydrate diet. Another followed the same low-carb diet plus a daily 1.5 oz. bar of dark chocolate. And the rest, a control group, were instructed to make no changes to their current diet.\n\n-- They weighed themselves each morning for 21 days, and the study finished with a final round of questionnaires and blood tests.\n\n## The Great Chocolate Hoak\n\n\"If you measure a large number of things about a small number of people, you are almost guaranteed to get a \"statistically significant\" result. Our study included 18 different measurements---weight, cholesterol, sodium, blood protein levels, sleep quality, well-being, etc.---from 15 people. . . .\"\n\n\"It was, in fact, a fairly typical study for the field of diet research. Which is to say: It was terrible science. The results are meaningless, and the health claims that the media blasted out to millions of people around the world are utterly unfounded.\"\n\n## \n\n![](images/10-data-ethics/exercise-cancer-latimes.png){width=\"900\" height=\"400\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Original study {.smaller}\n\nMoore, Steven C., et al.
