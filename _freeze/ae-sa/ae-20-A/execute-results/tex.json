We are going to use these data to investigate what we would of expected to pay for an Airbnb in in Asheville, NC in June 2020. Read in the data and answer the following questions. Today, we are going to investigate if the mean price of an Airbnb in Ashville, NC in June 2020 was larger than 60.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nabb <- read_csv(\"data/asheville.csv\")\n\nglimpse(abb)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 50\nColumns: 1\n$ ppg <dbl> 48.00000, 40.00000, 99.00000, 13.00000, 55.00000, 75.00000, 74.000~\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Setting up the hypotheses\n\nBased on the context of the problem, write out the correct null and alternative hypothesis.
