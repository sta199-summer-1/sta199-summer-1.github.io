Why or why not?\n\nNo. Not a good fit. Our response is categorical.\n\n*How do you build a model to fit a binary response variable (a categorical response variable with 2 outcomes)?*\n\n# Logistic regression\n\n**Logistic regression** takes in a number of explanatory variables and outputs the log-odds of \"success\" (an outcome of 1) in a binary response variable. The log-odds are then used to predict the probability of \"success\".\n\nLet's see what the logistic regression model looks like for our example:\n\nLet $p$ be the probability an email is spam.\n\n-   $\\frac{p}{1-p}$: odds an email is spam (if p = 0.7, then the odds are 0.7/(1 - 0.7) = 2.33)\n-   $\\log\\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big)$: \"log-odds\", i.e., the natural log, an email is spam\n\nThen, the logistic regression model using the number of exclamation points as an explanatory variable is\n\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times exclaim\\_mess$$\n\n\nThe probability an email is spam is\n\n\n$$p = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times exclaim\\_mess\\}}{1 + \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times exclaim\\_mess\\}}$$\n\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n-   Let's fit the logistic regression model using the number of exclamation points to predict the probability an email is spam.\n\nThings to note: We are no longer doing linear regression (we are doing logistic regression); We are not fitting a linear model (we are fitting a generalized linear model); we need to specify `family = binomial` in the fit function.\n\nName this model `spam_model`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspam_model <- logistic_reg() |>\n  set_engine(\"glm\") |>\n  fit(spam ~ exclaim_mess , data = email, family = \"binomial\") \n```\n:::\n\n\n-   How does the code above differ from previous code we've used to fit regression models?\n\nChanged linear_reg -\\> logistic_reg Changed lm -\\> glm Specified family = \"binomial\" **Made sure y was categorical**\n\n-   Now, compare your summary output to the estimated model below.\n\n\n$$\\log\\Big(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\Big) = -1.9114 - 0.1684 \\times exclaim\\_mess$$\n\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nWhat is the probability the email is spam if it contains 10 exclamation points?\n\nUse R as a calculator to calculate the predicted probability (do not use predict)\n\nFirst, calculate the log odds by plugging in 10.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n-1.91 - 0.168*10\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] -3.59\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, exponentiate!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexp(-3.59) / (1 + exp(-3.59))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 0.02685712\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe predicted probability of a spam email when the number of exclamation points equals 10 is \\~ 0.02.\n\nWe can use the predict function in R to produce the probability as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnew_email <- tibble(exclaim_mess = 10)\npredict(spam_model$fit, new_email) # log-odds\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n        1 \n-3.594985 \n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npredict(spam_model$fit, new_email, type = \"response\") # probability\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         1 \n0.02672713 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\nWe have the probability an email is spam, but ultimately we want to use the probability to classify an email as spam or not spam. Therefore, we need to set a **decision-making threshold**, such that an email is classified as spam if the predicted probability is greater than the threshold and not spam otherwise.\n\nSuppose you are a data scientist working on a spam filter. You must determine how high the predicted probability must be before you think it would be reasonable to call it spam and put it in the junk folder (which the user is unlikely to check).\n\nWhat are some tradeoffs you would consider as you set the decision-making threshold? Discuss with your neighbor.\n\nWe could consider the following situations:\n\n-- We don't want to much spam email in our inbox, so we want to make sure the threshhold is high enough to detect and filter out spam correctly -- We don't want actual mail to go into spam, we we want to make sure the threshhold is low enough to not falsely conclude normal messages as spam\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nemail <- email |>\n  mutate(pred_prob = predict(spam_model$fit, type = \"response\"))\nggplot(data = email) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = exclaim_mess, y = as.numeric(spam) -1, \n                        color = spam)) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = exclaim_mess, y = pred_prob)) + \n  labs(x = \"Number of exclamation points\", \n       y = \"Predicted probability an email is spam\", \n       color = \"Is email spam?\"\n       )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ae-15-A_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
