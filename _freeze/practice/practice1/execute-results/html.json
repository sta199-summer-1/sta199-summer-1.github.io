In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story [\"The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major\"](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/).\n\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see [the code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/college-majors/college-majors-rscript.R) FiveThirtyEight authors used.\n\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don't tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.\n\n# Getting started\n\n-   Go to the [sta199-sp23-2](https://github.com/sta199-s23-2) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix `practice1`. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the homework assignment.\n\n-   Clone the repo and start a new project in RStudio. See the [Lab 0 instructions](https://sta199-s23-2.github.io/labs/lab-0.html) for details on cloning a repo and starting a new R project.\n\n## Packages\n\nWe'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualization and the **scales** package for better formatting of labels on visualizations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'tidyr' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'readr' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: package 'purrr' was built under R version 4.2.2\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Data\n\nThe data originally come from the **fivethirtyeight** package but we'll use versions of the data that have been slightly modified to better suit this assignment. You can load the two data sets we'll be using for this analysis with the following:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmajor_income_undergrad <- read_csv(\"data/major_income_undergrad.csv\")\nmajor_income_grad <- read_csv(\"data/major_income_grad.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can also take a quick peek at your data frames and view their dimensions with the `glimpse` function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(major_income_undergrad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 172\nColumns: 12\n$ major_code                            <dbl> 5601, 6004, 6211, 2201, 2001, 32…\n$ major                                 <chr> \"Construction Services\", \"Commer…\n$ major_category                        <chr> \"Industrial Arts & Consumer Serv…\n$ undergrad_total                       <dbl> 86062, 461977, 179335, 37575, 53…\n$ undergrad_employed                    <dbl> 73607, 347166, 145597, 29738, 43…\n$ undergrad_employed_fulltime_yearround <dbl> 62435, 250596, 113579, 23249, 34…\n$ undergrad_unemployed                  <dbl> 3928, 25484, 7409, 1661, 3389, 5…\n$ undergrad_unemployment_rate           <dbl> 0.05066099, 0.06838588, 0.048422…\n$ undergrad_p25th                       <dbl> 47000, 34000, 35000, 29000, 3600…\n$ undergrad_median                      <dbl> 65000, 48000, 50000, 41600, 5200…\n$ undergrad_p75th                       <dbl> 98000, 71000, 75000, 60000, 7800…\n$ undergrad_sharewomen                  <dbl> 0.09071251, 0.69036529, 0.651659…\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(major_income_grad)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 172\nColumns: 11\n$ major_code                       <dbl> 5601, 6004, 6211, 2201, 2001, 6206, 1…\n$ major                            <chr> \"Construction Services\", \"Commercial …\n$ major_category                   <chr> \"Industrial Arts & Consumer Services\"…\n$ grad_total                       <dbl> 9173, 53864, 24417, 5411, 9109, 19099…\n$ grad_employed                    <dbl> 7098, 40492, 18368, 3590, 7512, 15157…\n$ grad_employed_fulltime_yearround <dbl> 6511, 29553, 14784, 2701, 5622, 12304…\n$ grad_unemployed                  <dbl> 681, 2482, 1465, 316, 466, 8324, 473,…\n$ grad_unemployment_rate           <dbl> 0.08754339, 0.05775585, 0.07386679, 0…\n$ grad_p25th                       <dbl> 110000, 89000, 100000, 85000, 83700, …\n$ grad_median                      <dbl> 75000, 60000, 65000, 47000, 57000, 80…\n$ grad_p75th                       <dbl> 53000, 40000, 45000, 24500, 40600, 50…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese two data sets have a trove of information. Three variables are common to both data sets:\n\n-   `major_code`: Major code, FO1DP in ACS PUMS\n-   `major`: Major description\n-   `major_category`: Category of major from Carnevale et al\n\nThe remaining variables start with either `grad_` or `undergrad_` suffix, depending on which dataset they are in. The descriptions of these variables is as follows.\n\n-   `*_total`: Total number of people with major\n-   `*_sample_size`: Sample size (unweighted) of full-time, year-round ONLY (used for earnings)\n-   `*_employe`d: Number employed (ESR == 1 or 2)\n-   `*_employed_fulltime_yearround`: Employed at least 50 weeks (WKW == 1) and at least 35 hours (WKHP \\>= 35)\n-   `*_unemployed`: Number unemployed (ESR == 3)\n-   `*_unemployment_rate`: Unemployed / (Unemployed + Employed)\n-   `*_p25th`: 25th percentile of earnings\n-   `*_median`: Median earnings of full-time, year-round workers\n-   `*_p75th`: 75th percentile of earnings\n\nFinally, `undergrad_sharewomen` is the proportion of women with the major, and we only have this information for undergraduates.\n\nLet's think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:\n\n-   Which major has the lowest unemployment rate?\n-   Which major has the highest percentage of women?\n-   How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\n-   How much are college graduates (those who finished undergrad) making?\n-   How do incomes of those with a graduate degree compare to those with an undergraduate degree?\n\nIn the following exercises we aim to answer these questions.\n\n# Exercises\n\n## Exercise 1\n\n**Which majors have the lowest unemployment rate?** Answer the question using a single data wrangling pipeline and focusing on undergraduates (`major_income_undergrad`). The output should be a tibble with the columns `major`, and `undergrad_unemployment_rate`, with the major with the lowest unemployment rate on top, and displaying the majors with the lowest 5 unemployment rates. Include a sentence listing the majors and the unemployment rates (as percentages).\n\n## Exercise 2\n\n**Which majors have the highest percentage of women?** Answer the question using a single data wrangling pipeline and focusing on undergraduates (`major_income_undergrad`). The output should be a tibble with the columns `major`, and `undergrad_sharewomen`, with the major with the highest proportion of women on top, and displaying the majors with the highest 5 proportions of women. Include a sentence listing the majors and the percentage of women with the major.\n\n## Exercise 3\n\n**How much are college graduates (those who finished undergrad) making?** For this exercise, focus on undergraduates (`major_income_undergrad`).\n\na.  Plot the distribution of all median incomes using a histogram with an appropriate binwidth.\n\nb.  Calculate the mean and median for median income. Based on the shape of the histogram, determine which of these summary statistics is useful for describing the distribution.\n\nc.  Describe the distribution of median incomes of college graduates across various majors based on your histogram from part (a) and incorporating the statistic you chose in part (b) to help your narrative. *Hint:* Mention shape, center, spread, any unusual observations.\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n**How do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?** For this exercise, focus on undergraduates (`major_income_undergrad`).\n\na.  Calculate a the minimum, median, and maximum median income per major category as well as the number of majors in each category. Your summary statistics should be in decreasing order of median median income.\n\nb.  Create box plots of the distribution of median income by major category.\n\n    -   The variable `major_category` should be on the y-axis and `undergrad_median` on the x-axis.\n    -   The order of the boxes in your plot should match the order in your summary table from part (a).\n    -   Use color to enhance your plot, and turn off any legends providing redundant information.\n    -   Style the x-axis labels such that the values are shown in thousands, e.g., 20000 should show up as \\$20K.\n\nc.  In 1-2 sentences, describe how median incomes across various major categories compare. Your description should also touch on where your own intended/declared major (yes, your major at Duke).\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br>\n\nOnce again, render, commit, and push. Make sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceeding.\n\n<br>\n:::\n\n## Exercise 5\n\nOne of the sections of the [FiveThirtyEight story](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) is \"All STEM fields aren't the same\". Let's see if this is true. Once again, focus on undergraduates (`major_income_undergrad`) for this exercise.\n\na.  First, let's create a new vector called `stem_categories` that lists the major categories that are considered STEM fields.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    stem_categories <- c(\n      \"Biology & Life Science\",\n      \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n      \"Engineering\",\n      \"Physical Sciences\"\n      )\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\n    Then, fill in the partial code to create a new variable in our data frame indicating whether a major is STEM or not. Note that you need to figure out the logical operator that goes into `___`. Double check that you have successfully created this variable by selecting the variables `major_type` and `major_category`.\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    major_income_undergrad <- major_income_undergrad |>\n      mutate(major_type = if_else(major_category ___ stem_categories, \"STEM\", \"Not STEM\"))\n    ```\n    :::\n\n\nb.  In a single pipeline, determine which STEM majors' median earnings are less than \\$55,000. Your answer should be a tibble with the columns `major`, `major_type`, and `undergrad_median`, arranged in order of descending `undergrad_median`.\n\n## Exercise 6\n\nFinally, we want to compare median incomes of STEM majors with and without a graduate degree in their major.\n\na.  To do so, we will first join data that contains information on median incomes of those with undergraduate and graduate degrees. Join the `major_income_undergrad` and the `major_income_grad` data sets by `major_code`. Join them in such a way where **only** rows that include the same `major_code` from each data set are included. Name the new data set `major_income`.\n\nb.  Create a new variable called `grad_multiplier` -- the ratio of median income of those with a graduate degree divided by median income of those with an undergraduate degree, for STEM majors. The result should be tibble with the variables `major`, `grad_multiplier`, `grad_median`, and `undergrad_median`. The results should be displayed in descending order of `grad_multiplier` and display the STEM majors with top 10 `grad_multiplier`.\n\nc.  Determine the number of rows of `major_income_undergrad` and `major_income_grad` as well as `major_income`. How come they don't all have the same number of rows?\n\n\\\n**Remember to follow proper style guidelines outlined below**\n\n::: callout-note\n-   putting your name in the YAML at the top of the document\n-   Are you under the 80 character code limit? (You shouldn't have to scroll to see all your code).\n-   Pipes `%>%`, `|>` and ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a new line\n-   You should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of `=` vs `<-` and `%>%` vs `|>`\n-   All binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example `x + y` is appropriate. `x+y` is not.\n:::\n",
