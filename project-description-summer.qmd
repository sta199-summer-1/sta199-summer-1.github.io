# Introduction

**TL;DR**: *Ask a question you're curious about and answer it with a dataset of your choice. This is your project in a nutshell.*

**May be too long, but please do read**

The final project for this class will consist of analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. The dataset should already exist. You can choose the data based on your teams' interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The goal of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.

The goal is not to do an exhaustive data analysis i.e., do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather let me know that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You do not have to apply every statistical procedure we learned.

The expectation is that you apply **at least one** statistical procedure. Statistical procedures that we will cover include *confidence intervals*, *modeling*, and *hypothesis testing*. If using more than one statistical procedures helps answer your question, feel free to do so. However, more does not mean better.

Once finished, think critically and critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed here.

The project is very open ended. You should start by exploring your data and create some kind of compelling visualization(s) of these data in R. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may use. You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. A single high-quality visualization will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. Also pay attention to your presentation. Neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio, using R, and all components of the project **must be reproducible** (with the exception of the presentation).

You will work on the project with your lab teams.

The four primary deliverables for the final project are

1.  A project **proposal** with two dataset ideas.
2.  A reproducible project **writeup** of your analysis, with one required and one optional draft along the way.
3.  A **presentation** with slides.

You will not be submitting anything on Gradescope for the project. Submission of these deliverables will happen on GitHub and feedback will be provided as GitHub issues that you need to engage with and close. The collection of the documents in your GitHub repo will create a webpage for your project. To create the webpage go to the Build tab in RStudio, and click on Render Website.

A large part of this project is the ability to demonstrate that you can work functionally in a group setting. Thus, there may be periodic surveys given to ensure that the group dynamic is productive and everyone is contributing. An individual's grade is subject to be different than your group members for each part of the project if there is overwhelming evidence that said individual is not contributing or communicating with the other team members. Survey evidence, GitHub commit history, and lab attendance will be used to dictate if any dedications need to be made to project component grades.

# Proposal {#project-proposal}

There are two main purposes of the project proposal:

-   To help you think about the project early, so you can get a head start on finding data, reading relevant literature, thinking about the questions you wish to answer, etc.
-   To ensure that the data you wish to analyze, methods you plan to use, and the scope of your analysis are feasible and will allow you to be successful for this project.

Identify 2 data sets you're interested in potentially using for the final project. If you're unsure where to find data, you can use the list of potential data sources in the [Tips + Resources](#tips--resources) section as a starting point. It may also help to think of topics you're interested in investigating and find data sets on those topics.

::: callout-important
You must use one of the data sets in the proposal for the final project, unless instructed otherwise when given feedback.

## Criteria for datasets

The data sets should meet the following criteria:

-   At least 300 observations (or approved by me)

-   At least 6 unique columns that are useful and not simply identifiers (or approved by me)

-   Data must be real

    -   Identifier variables such as "name", "social security number", etc. are not useful explanatory variables.
    -   If you have multiple columns with the same information (e.g. "state abbreviation" and "state name"), then they are not unique explanatory variables.

-   You may not use data that has previously been used in any course materials, or any derivation of data that has been used in course materials.

**Please ask a member of the teaching team if you're unsure whether your data set meets the criteria.**

## Resources for datasets

You can find data wherever you like, but here are some recommendations to get you started. You shouldn't feel constrained to datasets that are already in a tidy format, you can start with data that needs cleaning and tidying, scrape data off the web, or collect your own data.

## Proposal components

For each data set, include the following:

### Introduction and data

For each data set:

-   Identify the source of the data.

-   State when and how it was originally collected (by the original data curator, not necessarily how you found the data).

-   Write a brief description of the observations.

-   Address ethical concerns about the data, if any.

### Research question

Your research question should contain at least three variables, and should be a mix of categorical and quantitative variables. When writing a research question, please think about the following:

-   What is your target population?

-   Is the question original?

-   Can the question be answered?

For each data set, include the following:

-   A well formulated research question. (You may include more than one research question if you want to receive feedback on different ideas for your project. However, one per data set is required.)
-   Statement on why this question is important.
-   A description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.
-   Identify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?

### Literature

A literature review is an overview of the previously published works on a topic. It is good practice to familiarize yourself with published work that has already been done on the topic you are researching. Often, a literature review spans many articles, and allows the researcher to communicate how their research fits in / extends our current understanding of a topic. For this project, we will do a "mini" literature review. For each data set:

-   Find one published credible article on the topic you are interested in researching.

-   Provide a one paragraph summary about the article.

-   In 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.

You can find articles using `Google Scholar` or some other academic search engine. Please reach out if you have any questions about this.

### Glimpse of data

For each data set:

-   Place the file containing your data in the `data` folder of the project repo.
-   Use the `glimpse()` function to provide a glimpse of the data set.

## Proposal grading

| Total                   | 15 pts |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Introduction and data   | 3      |
| Research question       | 3      |
| Literature              | 3      |
| Glimpse of data         | 3      |
| Workflow and formatting | 3      |

Each component will be graded as follows:

-   **Meets expectations (full credit)**: All required elements are completed and are accurate. The narrative is written clearly, all tables and visualizations are nicely formatted, and the work would be presentable in a professional setting.

-   **Close to expectations (half credit)**: There are some elements missing and/or inaccurate. There are some issues with formatting.

-   **Does not meet expectations (no credit)**: Major elements missing. Work is not neatly formatted and would not be presentable in a professional setting.

It is critical to check feedback on your project proposal. Even if you earn full credit, it may not mean that your proposal is perfect.

## Reproducibility + organization

All written work (with exception of presentation slides) should be reproducible, and the GitHub repo should be neatly organized.

Points for reproducibility + organization will be based on the reproducibility of the written report and the organization of the project GitHub repo. The repo should be neatly organized as described above, there should be no extraneous files, all text in the README should be easily readable.

## Teamwork

You will be asked to fill out a survey where you rate the contribution and teamwork of each team member by assigning a contribution percentage for each team member. Filling out the survey is a prerequisite for getting credit on the team member evaluation. If you are suggesting that an individual did less than half the expected contribution given your team size (e.g., for a team of four students, if a student contributed less than 12.5% of the total effort), please provide some explanation. **If any individual gets an average peer score indicating that this was the case, their grade will be assessed accordingly and penalties may apply beyond the teamwork component of the grade.**

If this is not indicated on the survey, I will assume everyone on the team equally contributed and will receive full credit for the teamwork portion of the grade.

# Overall grading

The grade breakdown is as follows:

| Total                     | 100 pts |
|---------------------------|---------|
| **Project proposal**      | 15 pts  |
| **Draft report**          | 15 pts  |
| **Final report**          | 40 pts  |
| **Slides + presentation** | 20 pts  |
| **Teamwork**              | 10 pts  |

## Grading summary

Grading of the project will take into account the following:

-   Content - What is the quality of research and/or policy question and relevancy of data to those questions?
-   Correctness - Are statistical procedures carried out and explained correctly?
-   Writing and Presentation - What is the quality of the statistical presentation, writing, and explanations?
-   Creativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Are the limitations carefully considered? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?

A general breakdown of scoring is as follows:

-   *90%-100%*: Outstanding effort. Student understands how to apply all statistical concepts, can put the results into a cogent argument, can identify weaknesses in the argument, and can clearly communicate the results to others.
-   *80%-89%*: Good effort. Student understands most of the concepts, puts together an adequate argument, identifies some weaknesses of their argument, and communicates most results clearly to others.
-   *70%-79%*: Passing effort. Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.
-   *60%-69%*: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.
-   *Below 60%*: Student is not making a sufficient effort.

## Late work policy

**There is no late work accepted on this project.** Be sure to turn in your work early to avoid any technological mishaps.
