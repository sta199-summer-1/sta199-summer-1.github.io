For this ae, we'll use the **tidyverse** and **palmerpenguins** packages.

## Packages

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins) #The data set name is penguins
```

## Data

The dataset we will visualize is called `penguins`. Let's `glimpse()` at it.

```{r}
#| label: glimpse

glimpse(penguins)

```

# Visualizing penguin weights - Demo

## Single variable

::: callout-note
Analyzing the a single variable is called **univariate** analysis.
:::

Create visualizations of the distribution of `weight`s of penguins.

1.  Make a histogram by filling in the `...` with the appropriate arguments. Set an appropriate binwidth.

```{r}
#| label: histogram-weight


penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = body_mass_g)) + #type variable name here
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 300) #type geom here

```

2.  Now, make a boxplot of `weight`s of penguins.

```{r}
#| label: boxplot-weight

penguins |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_boxplot()

```

-------------------------------- Answer for #2 Below

3.  Add a theme to your boxplot! https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html

```{r}
#| label: theme

penguins |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
    geom_boxplot() + 
    theme_dark() # type theme here

```

## Two variables

::: callout-note
Analyzing the relationship between two variables is called **bivariate** analysis.
:::

Create visualizations of the distribution of `weight`s of penguins by `species`. Note: `aes`thetic is a visual property of one of the objects in your plot. Aesthetic options are:

-   shape
-   color
-   size
-   fill

4.  Make a histogram of penguins' weight where the bars are filled in by species type. Set an appropriate binwidth and alpha value.

```{r}
#| label: histogram-weight-species


penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species )) +
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, alpha = 1)

```

5.  What if we don't want the overlap? We can use `facet_wrap` to split the histograms apart! This function takes the name of the variable you want to split by, and how many cols/rows you want your plots to show up in.

```{r}
#| label: facet

penguins |>
  ggplot( 
       aes(x = body_mass_g, fill = species )) +
       geom_histogram(binwidth = 200, alpha = .7) +
       facet_wrap("species", ncol = 1)
```

6.  Create side-by-side boxplots to compare body mass across species. Turn off the legend so it is not displayed.

```{r}
#| label: boxplot-weight-species

penguins |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g, y = species)) + 
    geom_boxplot(show.legend = F)

```

7.  We need to think critically about color when thinking about creating visualizations for a larger audience: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html

We can create a colorblind friendly pallet using `scale_colour_viridis_d()`. Comment the code below to describe what it's doing:

```{r}
#| label: color-demo

p <- penguins |> 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = body_mass_g, y = bill_length_mm , color = species)
  ) + 
    geom_point() 


p

p + scale_colour_viridis_d()

```

8.  Let's use multiple geoms on a single plot. Be deliberate about the order of plotting. Our task is to recreate the following image below. Hint: This plot uses `theme_minimal` and `scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D")`.

Note: Themes are a powerful way to customize the non-data components of your plots: i.e. titles, labels, fonts, background, gridlines, and legends: `theme()`.

![](plot1.png){width="650" height="400" fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| label: re-create

penguins |>
  ggplot(
       aes(x = body_mass_g, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(binwidth = 500) +
  geom_jitter() +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D", end = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x= "Weight",
       y = "Species", 
       title= "Weight Disrtribution of Penguins") +
  theme(legend.position = "None")


```

## Optional

Make your own plot! Revist the geoms page here: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/

Here is a cool one!

```{r}
#| label: on-your-own

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = T) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "D", end = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Species by Sex",
    title = "Penguins by species and sex"
  )
```
