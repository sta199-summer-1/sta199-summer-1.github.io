## Packages for class

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Quarto is great

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## mtcars

For the remainder of the class, we will use the `mtcars` data set.

-   Take a glimpse of the data set using the `glimpse` function in R

```{r}

glimpse(mtcars)

```

You can run code in a few different ways. You can click the green arrow in the code chunk; use a keyboard short cut (Ctrl+Enter for PC; Cmd+Return for Mac). For a list of other keyboard shortcuts, please visit the following: https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE

**It's a good habit to `commit` and `push` after you answer questions. Do this now!**

-   Use `?` before the data set name to get more information about the pre-loaded data in R. Type this in the console.

-   Now, filter out the any cars who weigh more than 4000 lbs *in a single pipeline*.

```{r}

filter(mtcars, wt < 4)

# We often use the pipe 
mtcars |>
  filter(wt < 4)

```

-   Notice how the data were not overwritten by running `mtcars` in the console.

Now, filter out the any cars who weigh more than 4000 lbs and save the new data set named `small_cars`.

```{r}

small_cars <- mtcars |>
  filter(wt < 4)

```

-   Using your new data set, take the mean weight of cars using the `summarise` function. Report the mean below. Hint, look up the help file to the function, and scroll down to the examples.

```{r}

small_cars |> 
  summarise(mean = mean(wt))

```

## Render

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. Note: if something is wrong with your code, your document will not render.

## Optional

-   Visit the follow website: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html

Choose a function of your choice and try to implement it on these data below

```{r}

#insert code here

```
