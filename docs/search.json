    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install the preview build of RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nLectures (Prepare)\nPart of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will not repeat everything in the videos, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.\n\n\nApplication exercises (Practice)\nA majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. The AEs done in class (M, Tu, Th) are due at the end of the day on the following Friday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\nIn addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\n\n\nLabs (Perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (Perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (Perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (Perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.\n\n\nTeam work policy\nThe final project and several labs will be completed in teams. GitHub commits will be used to measure individual contribution to the assignment. All group members are expected to participate equally. Commit history may be used to give individual team members different grades. Your grade may differ from the rest of your group."

For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 1 day (24 hours) late. There will be a 10% deduction for a late assignment.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nExams cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nThe Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). Please email Ed if you fall into this situation. For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive.\nA last-minute technical issue, being gone for vacation, or forgetting a deadline is not an extenuating circumstances.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Elijah Meyer know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nEvery effort will be made to mark your work accurately. We are on your side, and want you to receive every point you have worked to earn. However, sometimes grading mistakes happen. If you believe that an error has been made, return the paper to the instructor within four days, stating your claim in writing.\nThe following claims will be considered for re-grading:\n– points are not totaled correctly;\n– the grader did not see a correct answer that is on your paper;\n– your answer is the same as the correct answer, but in a different form (e.g., you wrote a correct answer as 1/3 and the grader was looking for .333);\n– your answer to a free response question is essentially correct but stated slightly differently than the grader’s expectation.\nThe following claims will not be considered for re-grading:\n– arguments about the number of points lost;\n– arguments about question wording.\nConsidering re-grades consumes time and resources that TAs and the instructor would rather spend helping you understand material. Please bring only claims of type (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) to our attention.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nClass recording requests\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please email me (your professor). Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded and provided in the email.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."

    "text": "Dr. Elijah Meyer - Hello! I’m very excited to work with you all this semester. I’ve earned a Master’s degree in statistics and a Ph.D. in statistics with a focus in education from Montana State University. I have taught at STA199 at Duke University during the F22 and S23 semesters. My early research is in sports statistics, with an emphasis on spatial data visualizations to enhance sports strategy. My Ph.D. work is in how to best support graduate student instructors and early career teachers to use active learning in their classrooms. Currently, my research focus is around creating a dynamic interactive shiny application in R to better students’ understanding of statistics and data science. Other endeavors include creating an online data science course Coursera.\nPrior to my time at Duke, I’ve taught multiple sections of Introductory and Intermediate Statistics at Montana State, developed their Intermediate Statistics online course, and helped integrate R into the Introductory Statistics curricula. I prioritize community, communication, and respect in my classroom. I want to provide a space where we can freely talk about the material, embrace mistakes, and learn together throughout the semester.\nWhen I’m not in the books, I enjoy playing disc golf, tennis, basketball, and anything else that gets me outside and active. I’m looking forward to meeting you all and having a great semester!\n\n\n\nOffice hours\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nTBD\nOld Chemistry Building 208 / Zoom (Password: 5MYp7A)"

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to determine analyses types and addressed any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen.\nResults\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis results are clearly assessed and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\nDiscussion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the analysis results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.)\n\n\n\nLiterature Review\nThis section includes an overview of one previously published work on your topic of interest. This includes a summary on the author’s study design, findings/results, as well as how your study is related to + adds to the existing literature on the topic. You may use footnote citations for referenced literature.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe article is clearly referenced and the connection between the article you have chosen with your research is clear. The article is well summarized to the point that the reader understands the article “at a high level”, including how the study were designed and the results that came out of it. It is clearly articulated how your study pushes the existing literature on your topic of interest, answering the question “Why is your research important?”\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes any exploratory data analysis and a brief description of your statistical procedure. If you are fitting a model, explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\nIf you are conducting a hypothesis test or creating a confidence interval, justify your decision, specifically on how it relates to your research question. Justify if you are going to use theory or simulation based techniques. Use resulting output to help address your research question.\nYou may use more than one statistical method to answer your research question.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to determine analyses types and addressed any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis results are clearly assessed and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the analysis results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix or plots) is no longer than 10 pages."

Student has misunderstanding of concepts in several areas, has some trouble putting results together in a cogent argument, and communication of results is sometimes unclear.\n60%-69%: Struggling effort. Student is making some effort, but has misunderstanding of many concepts and is unable to put together a cogent argument. Communication of results is unclear.\nBelow 60%: Student is not making a sufficient effort."
