The data might not have column names.

Why? What should it be?\n\nIt’s a (categorical/quantitative) variable since the information came from the columns of the original data frame and R cannot know that these character strings represent years. The variable type should be (categorical/quantitative).\n\nDemo: Start over with pivoting, and this time also make sure year is a numerical variable in the resulting data frame. How does this code differ from above?\n\n\nstatsci |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = -c(degree,id),\n    names_to = \"year\",\n    names_transform = as.numeric,\n    values_to = \"n\"\n  )  \n\n# A tibble: 44 × 4\n      id degree                     year     n\n   <dbl> <chr>                     <dbl> <dbl>\n 1     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2011    NA\n 2     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2012     1\n 3     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2013    NA\n 4     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2014    NA\n 5     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2015     4\n 6     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2016     4\n 7     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2017     1\n 8     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2018    NA\n 9     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2019    NA\n10     1 Statistical Science (AB2)  2020     1\n# … with 34 more rows\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: What does an NA mean in this context? Hint: The data come from the university registrar, and they have records on every single graduates, there shouldn’t be anything “unknown” to them about who graduated when.\n\nNAs should actually be 0s."

Therefore, we need to set a decision-making threshold, such that an email is classified as spam if the predicted probability is greater than the threshold and not spam otherwise.\nSuppose you are a data scientist working on a spam filter. You must determine how high the predicted probability must be before you think it would be reasonable to call it spam and put it in the junk folder (which the user is unlikely to check).\nWhat are some tradeoffs you would consider as you set the decision-making threshold? Discuss with your neighbor.\nWe could consider the following situations:\n– We don’t want to much spam email in our inbox, so we want to make sure the threshhold is high enough to detect and filter out spam correctly – We don’t want actual mail to go into spam, we we want to make sure the threshhold is low enough to not falsely conclude normal messages as spam\n\nemail <- email |>\n  mutate(pred_prob = predict(spam_model$fit, type = \"response\"))\nggplot(data = email) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = exclaim_mess, y = as.numeric(spam) -1, \n                        color = spam)) + \n  geom_line(aes(x = exclaim_mess, y = pred_prob)) + \n  labs(x = \"Number of exclamation points\", \n       y = \"Predicted probability an email is spam\", \n       color = \"Is email spam?\"\n       )"

Pokemon is a Japanese media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company, founded by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Within this franchise, there are over 1000 different pokemon characters. In this activity, we are going to be taking estimating the mean height of them all.\nYou may load in the data set with the following code:\n\npokemon <-  read_csv(\"https://sta101.github.io/static/appex/data/pokemon.csv\")\n\nRows: 42 Columns: 15\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (4): name, leg_status, type_1, type_2\ndbl (11): pokedex_number, generation, height_m, weight_kg, bst, hp, atk, def...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nIn this analysis, we will use CLT-based inference to draw conclusions about the mean height among all Pokemon species.\nEDA\nLet’s start by looking at the distribution of height_m, the typical height in meters for a Pokemon species, using a visualization and summary statistics.\n\npokemon |>\n  ggplot(\n    aes(x = height_m)\n  ) + \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = .25, fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\nBelow, calculate the mean, standard deviation, and sample size below…\n\npokemon |>\n  summarise(mean_height = mean(height_m), \n            sd_height = sd(height_m), \n            n_pokemon = n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  mean_height sd_height n_pokemon\n        <dbl>     <dbl>     <int>\n1       0.929     0.497        42\n\n\nNow, we will start on using the Central Limit Theorem to draw conclusions about the \\(\\mu\\), the mean height in the population of Pokemon.\n\nWhat is the point estimate for \\(\\mu\\), i.e., the “best guess” for the mean height of all Pokemon? Use proper notation.\nWhat is the point estimate for \\(\\sigma\\), i.e., the “best guess” for the standard deviation of the distribution of Pokemon heights? Use proper notation.\nCLT Conditions\nBefore moving forward, let’s check the conditions required to apply the Central Limit Theorem. Are the following conditions met:\n\nIndependence?\n\nWe have no reason to believe this is violated, as we took a random sample\n\nSample size?\n\nYes, we have a sample size larger than 30\nCentral limit theorem\nRemember, when the independence and sample size assumptions are met, the central limit theorem states\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma / \\sqrt{n})\n\\]\nIf we know \\(\\sigma\\), we can construct a symmetric confidence interval for the true mean easily using qnorm() (using a normal distribution).\nFor example, if the true standard deviation in pokemon height is 0.4 meters, then to construct a 95% confidence interval:\n\nxbar <- pokemon |>\n  summarize(xbar = mean(height_m)) |>\n  pull(xbar)\n\nqnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), mean = xbar, sd = 0.4)\n\n[1] 0.1445858 1.7125570\n\n\nThis can be equivalently expressed\n\nzscore <- qnorm(0.025)\nxbar + zscore*0.4\n\n[1] 0.1445858\n\nxbar - zscore*0.4\n\n[1] 1.712557\n\n\nIn general, the confidence interval can be written as\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\pm z^* \\times SD(\\bar{x})\n\\]\nwhere \\(z^*\\) is the quantile of a standard normal distribution associated with our level of confidence and the \\(SD(\\bar{x})\\) is \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{n})\\)\nIn Practice\nIf \\(\\sigma\\) is unknown, it is more appropriate to be using a t-distribution to account for this additional uncertainty. We estimate the standard deviation of our sample mean with the standard error: ()\nMany researchers estimate \\(\\sigma_\\bar{x}\\) with () and still use qnorm() if our sample size is “large.” This is what we did in ae-18 and we will revisit it later in the activity.\nPractical confidence intervals\nWe don’t know the true population mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), how do we use CLT to construct a confidence interval?\nWe approximate \\(\\mu\\) by \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) by with \\(s\\). However \\(s\\) may be smaller than \\(\\sigma\\) and our confidence interval could be too narrow, for example, run the code below to compute the standard deviation of three draws from a standard normal.\n\nsamples = rnorm(3, mean = 0, sd = 1)\nsd(samples) / 3\n\n[1] 0.4858455\n\n\nRun this code a few times to repeat the simulation; you will find that \\(s\\) is sometimes above and sometimes below the true standard deviation we have set to 0.40.\nTo account for this uncertainty, we will use a distribution with thicker tails. This sampling distribution is called a t-distribution.\n\nggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(0 - 1*3, 0 + 1*3)), aes(x = x)) +\n  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),\n                color = \"black\") +\n  stat_function(fun = dt, args = list(df = 3),\n                color = \"red\",lty = 2) + theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Black solid line = normal, Red dotted line = t-distribution\")\n\n\n\n\nThe t-distribution has a bell shape but the extra thick tails help us correct for the variability introduced by using \\(s\\) instead of \\(\\sigma\\).\nUnlike the normal distribution…. there are many many many different t-distributions. We can distinguish the differences by their degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom describes the precise form of the bell-shaped t-distribution. In general, we’ll use a t-distribution with \\(df=n−1\\) to model the sample mean when the sample size is \\(n\\).\nWe can use qt and pt to find quantiles and probabilities respectively under the t-distribution.\nConfidence interval\nTo construct our practical confidence interval (where we don’t know \\(\\sigma\\)) we use the t-distribution:\n\\[\n\\bar{x} \\pm t^*_{n-1} \\times \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}\n\\]\nConfidence Interval\n\nCalculate the 95% confidence interval for pokemon height using the t-distribution.\n\n\ntscore <- qt(0.025 , df = 41)\n\ns <- sd(pokemon$height_m)\nn <- nrow(pokemon)\n\nxbar + tscore*(s/sqrt(n))\n\n[1] 0.7735551\n\nxbar - tscore*(s/sqrt(n))\n\n[1] 1.083588\n\n\nPenguins\nIn the last application exercise, we calculated a 95% confidence interval for true mean flipper length using a normal distribution (see code below). Let’s compare the results to a t-distribution…\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'palmerpenguins'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:modeldata':\n\n    penguins\n\nest_mu <- 201\nest_sigma <- sd(penguins$flipper_length_mm , na.rm = T) / sqrt(344)\n\nqnorm(c(0.025, 0.975), mean = est_mu, sd = est_sigma)\n\n[1] 199.514 202.486\n\ntscore <- qt(0.025 , df = 343)\nn <- 344\n\nest_mu + tscore*(est_sigma)\n\n[1] 199.5088\n\nest_mu - tscore*(est_sigma)\n\n[1] 202.4912\n\n\nAre they the same?

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install the preview build of RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nThe activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nLectures (Prepare)\nPart of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will not repeat everything in the videos, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.\n\n\nApplication exercises (Practice)\nA majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. The AEs done in class (M, Tu, Th) are due at the end of the day on the following Friday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\nIn addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\n\n\nLabs (Perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (Perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (Perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (Perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester.\n\n\nTeam work policy\nThe final project and several labs will be completed in teams. GitHub commits will be used to measure individual contribution to the assignment. All group members are expected to participate equally. Commit history may be used to give individual team members different grades. Your grade may differ from the rest of your group."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 1 day (24 hours) late. There will be a 10% deduction for a late assignment.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nExams cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nThe Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). Please email Ed if you fall into this situation. For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive.\nA last-minute technical issue, being gone for vacation, or forgetting a deadline is not an extenuating circumstances.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Elijah Meyer know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nEvery effort will be made to mark your work accurately. We are on your side, and want you to receive every point you have worked to earn. However, sometimes grading mistakes happen. If you believe that an error has been made, return the paper to the instructor within four days, stating your claim in writing.\nThe following claims will be considered for re-grading:\n– points are not totaled correctly;\n– the grader did not see a correct answer that is on your paper;\n– your answer is the same as the correct answer, but in a different form (e.g., you wrote a correct answer as 1/3 and the grader was looking for .333);\n– your answer to a free response question is essentially correct but stated slightly differently than the grader’s expectation.\nThe following claims will not be considered for re-grading:\n– arguments about the number of points lost;\n– arguments about question wording.\nConsidering re-grades consumes time and resources that TAs and the instructor would rather spend helping you understand material. Please bring only claims of type (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) to our attention.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nClass recording requests\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please email me (your professor). Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as STINFs, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded and provided in the email.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays."

I’ve earned a Master’s degree in statistics and a Ph.D. in statistics with a focus in education from Montana State University. I have taught at STA199 at Duke University during the F22 and S23 semesters. My early research is in sports statistics, with an emphasis on spatial data visualizations to enhance sports strategy. My Ph.D. work is in how to best support graduate student instructors and early career teachers to use active learning in their classrooms. Currently, my research focus is around creating a dynamic interactive shiny application in R to better students’ understanding of statistics and data science. Other endeavors include creating an online data science course Coursera.\nPrior to my time at Duke, I’ve taught multiple sections of Introductory and Intermediate Statistics at Montana State, developed their Intermediate Statistics online course, and helped integrate R into the Introductory Statistics curricula. I prioritize community, communication, and respect in my classroom. I want to provide a space where we can freely talk about the material, embrace mistakes, and learn together throughout the semester.\nWhen I’m not in the books, I enjoy playing disc golf, tennis, basketball, and anything else that gets me outside and active.

    "text": "Exercises\nFor all of the following exercises, you should include units on axes labels, e.g. “Bench press (lbs)” or “Bench press (kg)”. “Age (years)” etc. This is good practice.\n\nLet’s begin by taking a look at the squat powerlifting records. To begin, remove any observations that are negative for squat. Next, create a new column called best3_squat_lbs that converts the record from kg to lbs (you may have to google the conversion). Save your data frame as ipf_squat.\n\n\nUsing ipf_squat, create a scatter plot to investigate the relationship between squat (in lbs) and age. Age should be on the x-axis. Add a linear best fit line. Remove the standard error. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.\n\n\nWrite down the population linear model to predict lift squat lbs from age in \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(\\beta\\) notation. What is \\(x\\)? What is \\(y\\)? Next, fit the linear model. Use the ipf_squat data frame. Re-write your previous equation replacing \\(\\beta\\) with the numeric estimates. This is called the “fitted” (estimated) linear model. Interpret each estimate of \\(\\beta\\). Are the interpretations reasonable?\nBuilding on your ipf_squat data frame, create a new column called age2 that takes the age of each lifter and squares it. Save your data frame with an appropriate name. Next, plot squat in lbs vs age2 and add a linear best fit line. Do you notice any difference in how well this model fits the data? Justify your answer.\nOne metric to assess the fit of a model is the correlation squared, also known as \\(R^2\\). Fit the age\\(^2\\) model and save the object as age2Fit. Subsequently report the \\(R^2\\). Compare \\(R^2\\) of the age\\(^2\\) model to the model from exercise 2. Which model do you prefer?\n\n\nIf you were to add body weight as a second predictor to the age\\(^2\\) model, would \\(R^2\\) increase or decrease? Explain.\n\n\nStarting with the original ipf dataframe, filter and mutate the data as we did in exercise 1, but this time filtering for best3bench_kg \\(>0\\) and creating a best3_bench_lbs variable, a bodyweight_lbs variable, and a sex variable that is a factor rather than a character. Fit an interaction effects model with bodywieght (in lbs) and sex as predictors of best bench press (in lbs). Write down the fitted model equation only, replacing \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) with the fitted estimates. What does it mean for bodyweight and sex to interact when modeling bench press? Hint: use the definition.\nPlot the model from exercise 5. Bodyweight should be on the x-axis. Add a linear best fit line. Be sure to label all axes and give the plot a title. Comment on what you observe.\nDo lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters? Does this vary across sexes? We’ll answer this question in two parts. First, remove all observations from the data frame that have NA listed under bench press. Next, create a new column called doping_status that takes value doping if the lifter failed a drug test and not doping otherwise. Save this data frame as ipf_dope.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nCheck the data dictionary at the top to figure out what variables will help you build the doping_status column.\n\n\n\nUsing ipf_dope from the previous exercise, compute the 5%, 50%, 95% quantiles for bench press across all combinations of sex and doping_status, i.e., male and doping, male and not doping, female and doping, female and not doping. You can use either bench press in kg or lbs here. With this information, answer the question “Do lifters who fail a drug test perform better or worse at bench press than other lifters?”"

Please correct the statement as well (without running any code).\nReport the mean race time for races 170 km or longer and construct a 99% bootstrap confidence interval for the mean race time using set.seed(6) and 5000 reps.\nNow, using the same set.seed, calculate a 95% bootstrap confidence interval for mean race time for races 170 km or longer using 5000 reps. What following characteristics changed compared to the interval created in question 3. (Please answer Yes or No to each of the following. If you answer yes, explain the change observed.)\n\n\nThe center of the confidence interval\nThe width of the confidence interval\n\n\nDoes the standard deviation of the bootstrap distribution change when you change confidence levels? Use appropriate code to justify your answer. (Note: the standard deviation of the bootstrap resampled means is an estimate of the standard error of our statistic!)\n\n\nExplain the process of how one observation (one dot) was created on your bootstrap distribution used to create your confidence interval in question 4. Be specific.\nIs it appropriate to construct a 99% confidence interval for mean race time for races 170 km or longer using the central limit theorem? Why or why not?\n\n\nRegardless of your answer above, use CLT to construct a 99% confidence interval for mean race time for races 170 km or longer. Compare your result to your bootstrap interval in question 3. Then, interpret the interval in the context of the problem.\n\n\nGiven the race was in Argentina, what is the median race time in seconds? Can you use Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to construct a confidence interval about this estimate? Explain. If not, construct a 90% bootstrap confidence interval for the median race time in seconds. Use set.seed(8) and 10000 reps. Interpret your interval in context.\nA fellow colleague wants your next investigation to be about mean race times in France. They are adamant that we must use 80% confidence intervals when reporting results. In 1-2 sentences, discuss both any potential benefits and concerns you may have with creating a confidence interval with this low of level."

    "text": "Exercises\nInvestigating sleep\n\n\nFind the mean time it takes the participant to fall asleep.\nCheck whether or not you can use central limit theorem to construct a 95% confidence interval to report with your estimate. For purposes of this exercise, you may consider samples of time to sleep as random.\nIf you can use CLT, please do so to construct and report the confidence interval. Otherwise, construct a bootstrap confidence interval with set.seed(5) and 10000 reps. Interpret your interval in context.\n\n\nDoes the participant take more than 35 minutes on average to fall asleep? Perform a hypothesis test to investigate. What is the null? What is the alternative? Use set.seed(2) and reps=5000 to simulate a distribution under the assumption of the null hypothesis.\n\nVisualize the null distribution and shade the p-value. Be sure to label the x-axis.\nWrite a proper decision and conclusion based on a significance level of \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05. Given your response from the previous exercise, does this result surprise you? Why or why not?\nWhat is the probability of rejecting the null if it’s actually true? What type of error is this (type 1 or type 2)?\n\n\n\nDo calcium-magnesium supplements reduce median time to fall asleep? Construct a hypothesis test to investigate. To begin, state the null and alternative hypothesis in words and in proper notation.\nUse simulation-based inference to generate 5000 samples from the null distribution with set.seed(5).\nCompute and state your observed statistic.\nFinally, compute the p-value and report it as well as significance at the alpha = 0.05 level and state your conclusion in context of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor the following problem, you will need to mutate to ensure that one of the variables is non-numeric.\n\n\n\nThe more time an individual spends lying in bed, awake, and trying to sleep, the worse their overall quality of sleep. To begin investigating quality of sleep, create a new column timeAwake that shows the total number of minutes the individual spent in bed but not asleep. When timeAwake is large, sleep is awful and interrupted. Save your data frame with the new column as sleep2.\n\nExample: TTS is the time to fall asleep, TBT is total bed time, i.e. total time spent, lying in bed and trying to sleep.\nSo if the participant gets into bed at 9:00pm and then falls asleep at 9:30pm and wakes up at 1:00am and lies awake for an hour only to finally sleep until 6:00am and gets out of bed then\n\n\nTTS is 30 minutes,\n\nTBT is 9 hours,\nTotal Sleep Time (TST) is 3.5h + 4h = 7.5 hours and the total time awake is 1.5 hours.\n\n\n\nHypothesis: Most nights, the participant spends over fifty minutes lying in bed awake. Construct a hypothesis test to investigate. To begin, state the null and alternative hypothesis in words and in statistical notation.\nUse simulation-based inference to generate 5000 samples from the null distribution with set.seed(8).\nCompute and state your observed statistic.\nFinally, compute the p-value and report. Interpret your p-value in the context of the problem.\nAt a significance at the alpha = 0.01 level, write your conclusion in the context of the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nFor the next exercise, start with sleep2 from the previous exercise.\n\n\nBeyond this class: pick a package\n\nIn this exercise, you will find a new package that you haven’t used in class and learn how to use it. Being able to find new packages, install them, read the documentation and finally use the package is an essential skill beyond the classroom.\n\nTo begin,\n\nPick a package. You can choose one from the list below, or venture into the great unknown and find another online. If you have trouble getting a package to work, ask for help on slack or come to office hours.\nInstall the package. Be sure to do this in the Console, not in your Quarto document because you do not want to keep re-installing every time you render the document.\n\nDepending on where the package comes from, how you install the package differs:\n\nIf the package is on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), you can install it with install.packages.\nIf the package is only on Github (most likely because it is still under development), you need to use the install_github function, click here for more details.\nLoad the package. Regardless of how you installed the package you can load it with the library function.\nDo something with the package. Typically, simpler is better. The goal is for you to read and understand the package documentation to carry out a simple task.\nFinally, write a short 3-4 sentence statement (at the beginning of your solution to this exercise) and include:\n\n\nThe name of the package you use and whether it is from CRAN or GitHub\nA short description of what the package does (in your own words)\nA short description of what you do with the package.\n\nSample list of packages on CRAN:\n\n\npackage name\ndescription\n\n\n\nape\nManipulate, plot and interact with phylogenetic trees and models.

    "text": "Data visualization and summary\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data <- datasaurus_dozen |>\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |>, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: <-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficient, often referred to as \\(r\\) in statistics, measures the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate \\(r\\) only if relevant. In this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear (it’s dinosaurial)!\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStart with `dino_data` and calculate a summary statistic that we will call `r` as the `cor`relation between `x` and `y`.\n\n\n\ndino_data |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n\nThis is a good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 2.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the circle dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nThis is another good place to pause, render, and commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 3.”\nThen, push these changes when you’re done.\n\n\nPlot y vs. x for the star dataset. You can (and should) reuse code we introduced above, just replace the dataset name with the desired dataset. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this dataset. How does this value compare to the r of dino?\n\n\nYou should pause again, render, commit changes with the commit message “Added answer for Ex 4”.\nThen, push.\n\nFinally, let’s plot all datasets at once. In order to do this we will make use of faceting, given by the code below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFacet by the dataset variable, placing the plots in a 3 column grid, and don’t add a legend.\n\n\n\nggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, color = dataset))+\n  geom_point()+\n  facet_wrap(~ dataset, ncol = 3) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\nAnd we can use the group_by function to generate all the summary correlation coefficients. We’ll go through these functions next week when we learn about data wrangling.\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |>\n  group_by(dataset) |>\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y)) \n\n\nInclude the faceted plot and the summary of the correlation coefficients in your lab write-up by including relevant code in R chunks (and give them appropriate labels). In the narrative below the code chunks, briefly comment on what you notice about the plots and the correlations between x and y values within each of them (one or two sentences is fine!).\n\nYou’re done with the data analysis exercises, but we’d like to do one more thing to customize the look of the report."

All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\nTo get started, load the data and save the data frame as parasites.\n\nLet’s start by examining the relationship between divergence_time and parsim.\n\nBased on the goals of the analysis, what is the response variable?\nVisualize the relationship between the two variables.\nUse the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 1 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document.

All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll model this relationship.\n\nFit the model and write the estimated regression equation.\nInterpret the slope and the intercept in the context of the data.\nRecreate the visualization from Exercise 1, this time adding a regression line to the visualization.\nWhat do you notice about the prediction (regression) line that may be strange, particularly for very large divergence times?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 2 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 3. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\n\nSince parsim takes values between 0 and 1, we want to transform this variable so that it can range between (−∞,+∞). This will be better suited for fitting a regression model (and interpreting predicted values!)\n\nUsing mutate, create a new variable transformed_parsim that is calculated as log(parsim/(1-parsim)). Add this variable to your data frame. Note: log() in R represents taking the nautral log.\nThen, visualize the relationship between divergence_time and transformed_parsim. Add a regression line to your visualization.\nWrite a 1-2 sentence description of what you observe in the visualization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 3 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 4. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\n\nWhich variable is the strongest individual predictor of parasite similarity between species? To answer this question, begin by fitting separate linear regression models predicting transformed_parsim with each of the following predictor variables:\n\ndivergence_time\ndistance\nBMdiff\nprecdiff\n\n\n\nDo not report the model outputs in a tidy format but save each one as dt_model, dist_model, BM_model, and prec_model, respectively. Then,\n\nReport the slopes for each of these models. Use proper notation.\nTo answer the question of interest, would it be useful to compare the slopes in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 4 renders, commits, and pushes, another team member should pull their changes and render the document. Then, they should write the answer to Exercise 5. All others should contribute to the discussion but only one person should type up the answer, render the document, commit, and push to GitHub. All others should not touch the document.\n\n\n\nRegardless of your answer to exercise 4b, we will also calculate the \\(R^2\\) of each model to help us identify the strongest individual linear predictor of transformed_parsim. \\(R^2\\) measures the percent of the variability in the response that is explained by the model.\n\nAs you may have guessed from the name, \\(R^2\\) can be calculated by squaring the correlation when we have a simple linear regression model. The correlation, r, takes values between -1 and 1, so \\(R^2\\) takes a value between 0 and 1. Intuitively, if r=1 or −1, then \\(R^2\\)=1, indicating the model perfectly fits the data. If r≈0 then \\(R^2\\)≈0, indicating the model is a very bad fit for the data.\nYou can calculate \\(R^2\\) using the glance function. For example, you can calculate \\(R^2\\) for dt_model using the code glance(dt_model)$r.squared.\n\nCalculate and report \\(R^2\\) for each model fit in the previous exercise.\nTo answer the question of interest, would it be useful to compare the \\(R^2\\) in each model to choose the variable that is the strongest predictor of parasite similarity? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter the team member working on Exercise 5 renders, commits, and pushes, all other team members should pull the changes and render the document. Finally, a team member different than the one responsible for typing up responses to Exercise 5 should do the last task outlined below."

In this case, we don’t want to claim sunflower feed leads to higher expected chick weight if in fact it does not. So we want to set a bar high enough that we should rarely incur type 1 error.\nAn experimenter will often decide in advance what is an acceptable false positive rate. In many situations, by convention, the threshold of requiring p-values below 0.05 is adopted.\n\nSuppose a scientist repeats the experiment 100 times in a row. If the true difference in weight between group is in fact 0, in roughly how many of the experiments would the scientist expect to find a p-value of less than 0.05?\n\nThe phenomenon described in part (a) is called p-hacking. The idea is that, by design, a “significance threshold” of level \\(\\alpha\\) will mean that, even if we only conduct experiments for which the null hypothesis is always true, we will expect to reject the null with probability \\(\\alpha\\). Thus, if you simply conduct enough experiments then eventually you will have “significant” findings even if the true effect is nonexistent.\n\nSuppose we would like to compare all pairs of feed groups to test for differences in expected weight. There are 6 types of feed, so there are \\({6 \\choose{2}} = 6*5/2 = 15\\) pairs we could compare. If we reject the null hypothesis for any p-value less than or equal to 0.05, and we assume the p-values are independent for each pair, and we also assume the null is true for every comparison, what is the probability that we don’t reject the null for any of the pairs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nP(A, B) = P(A)P(B) when events A and B are independent.\n\n\n\nBased on your answer in part b, if we compared all 15 pairs of feeds for differences in expected weight, assuming the p-values are independent for each pair, what is the probability that we will make a type 1 error (i.e., the probability that we do reject the null for at least one pair)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nP(\\(A\\)) + P(\\(A^C\\)) = 1 where \\(A^C\\) denotes “not \\(A\\)”.

    "text": "Exercise 6 - Bonferroni Correction\nIf the probability of event \\(A\\) is \\(p_1\\) and the probability of event \\(B\\) is \\(p_2\\), the largest possible probability for the either the event \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) occuring is \\(p_1 + p_2\\). Hence, in the worst possible case, if we perform a series of tests \\(T_1, \\dots, T_k\\) calibrated to have type 1 error probabilities \\(p_1, \\dots, p_k\\), the largest possible probability that at least one of the tests results in a type 1 error is \\(p_1 + \\dots + p_k\\).\nIf all of the tests have a common type 1 error probability \\(p^*\\), then this value will equal \\(kp^*\\).\n\nIf we were to perform all pairwise tests for the chickwts data set, what p-value threshold must we use if we want to guarantee that the probability of one or more type 1 errors is less than 0.05?\n\nThis “higher bar” for p-values in multiple testing situations is called the Bonferroni correction.\n\nI will spare you from performing all possible pairwise comparisons. However, you can see from the plots in exercise 3 that the difference in sample means between the sunflower and horsebean groups will likely be the greatest of any pair in the data set. If we began our experiment with no particular hypothesis and choose to formally compare these two groups based on a visualization, we are implicitly performing multiple testing by pre-screening out all pairs which do not have an obvious visual difference, thus we should impose a higher bar on the evidence for rejecting our null if we wish to maintain a low type 1 error rate overall. Is that pair significantly different if we use the Bonferroni-corrected threshold from part (a) above?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\nRe-use your code from exercise 4(c) with the necessary modifications."

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to determine analyses types and addressed any concerns over appropriateness of analyses chosen.\nResults\nThis is where you will discuss your overall finding and describe the key results from your analysis. The goal is not to interpret every single element of an output shown, but instead to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis results are clearly assessed and interesting findings from the analysis are described. Interpretations are used to to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing, e.g., the interpretation of every model coefficient.\nDiscussion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the analysis results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
